tc_298,Which was the only eastern bloc country to participate in the 1984 LA Olympics?,"Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum
The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIII Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Los Angeles , California , United States in 1984. When Tehran , the only other interested city on the international level, declined to bid due to the concurrent Iranian political and social changes, the IOC awarded Los Angeles the Games by default. This was the second occasion Los Angeles hosted the games; it previously hosted in 1932 .
In response to the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, 14 Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union , Cuba and East Germany , boycotted the Games ; only Romania elected to attend. For differing reasons, Iran and Libya also boycotted. The USSR announced its intention not to participate on May 8, 1984, citing security concerns and ""chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States."" Boycotting countries organized another large event in June–September 1984, called the Friendship Games ; however, not even a single competition was held between July 28 and August 12. Representatives of the organizing countries, the Soviets in particular, underlined it was ""not held to replace the Olympics"". Elite athletes from the U.S. and USSR would only compete against each other at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow, organized in response to the boycotts.
Where ambitious construction for the 1976 games in Montreal and 1980 games in Moscow had saddled organizers with expenses greatly in excess of revenues, Los Angeles strictly controlled expenses by using existing facilities except a swim stadium and a velodrome that were paid for by corporate sponsors. The Olympic Committee led by Peter Ueberroth used some of the profits to endow the LA84 Foundation to promote youth sports in Southern California, educate coaches and maintain a sports library. The 1984 Summer Olympics are often considered the most financially successful modern Olympics. [4]
The host state of California was the home state of U.S. President Ronald Reagan , who officially opened the Games. He had served as Governor of California from 1967 to 1975. The official mascot of the Los Angeles Games was Sam the Olympic Eagle . The logo of the games featured five blue, white and red stars arranged horizontally and struck through with alternating streaks; it was named ""Stars in Motion."" These were the first Summer Olympic Games under the IOC Presidency of Juan Antonio Samaranch .
On July 18, 2009, a 25th anniversary celebration was held in the main stadium. This celebration included a speech by the former president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee, Peter Ueberroth, and a re-creation of the lighting of the cauldron.
Host selection
The selection process for the 1984 Summer Olympics consisted of a single finalized bid, with the International Olympic Committee accepting the bid of Los Angeles. A bid from Tehran was withdrawn before the selection. Los Angeles had unsuccessfully bid for the two previous Summer Olympics, for 1976 and 1980. The United States Olympic Committee had at least one bid for every Olympics since 1944 , but had not succeeded since the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932 , the previous time a single bid had been issued for the Summer Olympics. [5]
Torch relay
The 1984 Olympic Torch Relay began in New York City and ended in Los Angeles, traversing 33 states and the District of Columbia. Unlike later torch relays, the torch was continuously carried by runners on foot. The route covered more than 9,320 mi (15,000 km) and involved 3,636 runners, including 200 from the sponsoring company AT&T . Noted athlete O.J. Simpson was among the runners, carrying the torch up the California Incline in Santa Monica . Gina Hemphill, granddaughter of Jesse Owens, carried the torch into the Coliseum, completed a lap around the track, then handed it off to the final runner, Rafer Johnson , winner of the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics . With the torch, he touched off the flame which passed through a specially designed flammable Olympic logo, igniting all five rings. The flame then passed up to cauldron atop the peristyle and remained aflame for the duration of the Games.
Music
John Williams composed the theme for the Olympiad, "" Olympic Fanfare and Theme "". This piece won a Grammy for Williams and became one of the most well-known musical themes of the Olympic Games, along with Leo Arnaud 's "" Bugler's Dream ""; the latter is sometimes attached to the beginning of Olympic Fanfare and Theme. Composer Bill Conti also wrote a song to inspire the weightlifters called ""Power"". An album, The Official Music of the XXIII Olympiad—Los Angeles 1984, featured three of those tracks along with sports themes written for the occasion by popular musical artists including Foreigner , Toto , Loverboy , Herbie Hancock , Quincy Jones , Christopher Cross , Philip Glass and Giorgio Moroder .

tc_518,What was Eddie Murphy's first movie?,"Birthplace:
Brooklyn, New York
The son of a Brooklyn policeman who died when he was eight, African-American comedy superstar Eddie Murphy was raised in the comfortable middle-class community of Hempstead, NY, by his mother and stepfather. A natural-born class clown, he was voted the most popular student at Roosevelt Junior and Senior High. By the age of 15, he was doing standup gigs at 25 to 50 dollars a pop, and within a few years he was headlining on the comedy-club circuit.
Murphy was 19 he was when hired as one of the backup performers on the NBC comedy weekly Saturday Night Live. His unique blend of youthful arrogance, sharkish good cheer, underlying rage, and street-smart versatility transformed the comedian into SNL's prime attraction, and soon the country was reverberating with imitations of such choice Murphy characterizations as sourball celebrity Gumby, inner-city kiddie host Mr. Robinson, prison poet Tyrone Green, and the Little Rascals' Buckwheat. Just when it seemed that he couldn't get any more popular, Murphy was hastily added to the cast of Walter Hill's 1982 comedy/melodrama feature film 48 Hours, and voila, an eight-million-dollars-per-picture movie star was born. The actor followed this cinematic triumph with John Landis' Trading Places, a Prince and the Pauper update released during the summer of 1983, the same year that the standup album Eddie Murphy, Comedian won a Grammy. In 1984, he finally had the chance to carry a picture himself: Beverly Hills Cop, one of the most successful pictures of the decade. Proving that at this juncture Murphy could do no wrong, his next starring vehicle, The Golden Child (1986), made a fortune at the box office, despite the fact that the picture itself was less than perfect. After Beverly Hills Cop 2 and his live standup video Eddie Murphy Raw (both 1987), Murphy's popularity and career seemed to be in decline, though his staunchest fans refused to desert him. His esteem rose in the eyes of many with his next project, Coming to America (1987), a reunion with John Landis that allowed him to play an abundance of characters -- some of which he essayed so well that he was utterly unrecognizable.
Murphy bowed as a director, producer, and screenwriter with Harlem Nights (1989), a farce about 1930s black gangsters which had an incredible cast (including Murphy, Richard Pryor, Della Reese, Redd Foxx, Danny Aiello, Jasmine Guy, and Arsenio Hall), but was somewhat destroyed by Murphy's lazy, expletive-ridden script and clichéd plot that felt recycled from Damon Runyon stories. Churned out for Paramount, the picture did hefty box office (in the 60-million-dollar range) despite devastating reviews and reports of audience walkouts. Murphy's box-office triumphs continued into the '90s with a seemingly endless string of blockbusters, such as the Reginald Hudlin-directed political satire The Distinguished Gentleman (1992), that same year's ""player"" comedy Boomerang, and the Landis-directed Beverly Hills Cop III (1994). After an onscreen absence of two years following Cop, Murphy reemerged with a 1996 remake of Jerry Lewis' The Nutty Professor. As directed by Tom Shadyac and produced by the do-no-wrong Brian Grazer, the picture casts Murphy as Dr. Sherman Klump, an obese, klutzy scientist who transforms himself into Buddy Love, a self-obsessed narcissist and a hit with women. As an added surprise, Murphy doubles up his roles as Sherman and Buddy by playing each member of the Klump family (beneath piles and piles of latex). The Nutty Professor grossed dollar one and topped all of Murphy's prior efforts, earning well up into the hundreds of millions and pointing the actor in a more family-friendly direction. His next couple of features, Dr. Dolittle and the animated Mulan (both 1998), were children-oriented affairs, although in 1999 he returned to more mature material with the comedies Life (which he also produced) and Bowfinger; and The PJs, a fairly bawdy claymation sitcom about life in Sout

How The Race To The South Pole Went Down
By Cassie Crofts 14 December 2016
How The Race To The South Pole Went Down
The competition in the early 20th century still stands as a symbol of the harrowing nature of polar exploration.
Comment
European and American explorers had attempted to reach the South Pole since British Capt. Robert Falcon Scott's expedition of 1904. Scott, along with fellow Antarctic explorers Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson, came within 660 kilometres of the pole, but turned back due to weather and inadequate supplies.
Shackleton and Scott were determined to reach the pole. Scott worked with scientists, intent on using the best techniques to gather data and collect samples.
Shackleton also conducted scientific surveys, although his expeditions were more narrowly focused on reaching the South Pole. He came within 160 kilometres of the pole in 1907, but again had to turn back due to weather.
Scott gathered public support and public funding for his 1910 Terra Nova expedition. He secured provisions and scientific equipment. In addition to the sailors and scientists on his team, the Terra Nova expedition also included tourists – guests who helped finance the voyage in exchange for taking part in it.
On the way to Antarctica, the Terra Nova expedition stopped in Australia to take on final supplies. Here, Scott received a surprising telegram from Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen: ""Beg leave to inform you Fram [Amundsen's ship] proceeding Antarctic.""
[Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott and his group – Creative Commons]
Amundsen was apparently racing for the pole, ahead of Scott, but had kept all preparation secret. His initial ambition, to be the first to reach the North Pole, had been thwarted by American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert Peary, both of whom claimed to reach the North Pole first. (Both claims are now disputed, and Amundsen's flight over the North Pole is generally recognised as the first verified journey there.)
The Terra Nova and Fram expeditions arrived in Antarctica about the same time, in the middle of the Antarctic summer (January). They set up base camps about 640 kilometres apart. As they proceeded south, both expeditions established resupply depots with supplies for their return journey. While Scott's team stuck to a route forged by Shackleton years earlier, Amundsen took a new route.
Scott proceeded with scientific and expeditionary equipment hauled by dogs, ponies, and motor sledges. The motorized equipment soon broke down, and the ponies could not adapt to the harsh Antarctic climate. Even the sled dogs became weary. All the ponies died, and most members of the expedition turned back. Only four men from the Terra Nova expedition (including Scott's friend Wilson) proceeded with Scott to the pole.
Amundsen travelled by dog sled, with a team of explorers, skiers, and mushers. The foresight and navigation paid off: Amundsen reached the pole in December 1911. He called the camp Polheim, and the entire Fram expedition successfully returned to their resupply depots, ship, and Norway.
[The routes to the South Pole taken by Scott (green) and Amundsen (red) – Creative Commons]
More than a month later, Scott reached the South Pole, only to be met by Amundsen's camp – he had left a tent, equipment, and supplies for Scott, as well as a note for the King of Norway to be delivered if the Fram expedition failed to make it back.
Disheartened, Scott's team slowly headed back north. They faced colder temperatures and harsher weather than Amundsen's team. They had fewer supplies. Suffering from hunger, hypothermia, and frostbite, all members of Scott's South Pole expedition died fewer than 18 kilometres from a resupply depot.
American explorer Richard E. Byrd became the first person to fly over the South Pole, in 1926, and the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station was established thirty years later.
However, the next overland expedition to the South Pole was not made until 1958, more than 40 years after Amundsen and Scott's deadly race.
The 1958 expedition was led by legendary New Zealand mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary, who had become the first person to scale Mount Everest in 1953.",Edmond Hillary; Sir Edmund Hillary; Edmund Hilary; Sir Ed; Sir Edmund Hilary; Sir Edmund Percival Hillary; Edmond Hillary; Ed Hillary; Edmond hillary; Sir Edmund; Edmund Percival Hillary; Edmund Hillary,"There is no mention of a specific person reaching the South Pole overland after Scott in the context.

tc_954,On what date in 1969 did Neil Armstrong first set foot on the Moon?,"BBC ON THIS DAY | 21 | 1969: 'One small step for man'
About This Site | Text Only
1969: 'One small step for man'
Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin are the founding members of one of the world's most exclusive clubs.
They were the first men ever to set foot on the Moon on 21 July 1969, and only another 10 followed them over the course of the next three-and-a-half years.
A lunar landing had been the stuff of science-fiction just a few years previously, and around the world millions of people watched the mission with mixed emotions of awe, fascination, pride and fear.
Some of you sent your memories:
Although I had only recently celebrated my fifth birthday, I have a very vivid memory of that day.
We were all glued to the television at our kitchen table.
My brothers and sister and I were gathered around our parents.  I was the smallest boy, so I got the privilege of sitting on Dad's lap.
I remember, my father being very quiet and mindful of what was being described on TV.
Then when Neil Armstrong started down the ladder, I felt a tremor run through my Dad.  When he made his famous speech, I felt something wet drop onto the top of my head - I turned to see profuse tears streaming from my father's eyes and rolling over his cheeks.
My father would later say, ""Even serving in the war (WWII) paled in comparison."" He was never more proud of being an American than on the day our flag flew on the moon.
Christopher Flournoy, USA
I was 12 years old in 1969.
Here in Australia, the Moonwalk happened at lunchtime - and we were privileged to see better pictures than the rest of the world.
That's because the TV of Neil Armstrong's first step came through the Honeysuckle Creek tracking station near Canberra. Several minutes into the Moonwalk, even better TV was also available from the larger Parkes Radio Telescope.
Australian TV audiences saw these pictures instead of those relayed via Houston (the first of which of which came from the Goldstone station, which had the very dark picture).
The Dish is a lovely light-hearted movie about the role of the Parkes Radio Telescope in western NSW - set during Apollo 11.
I loved the movie - but the story it tells is that Parkes saved the day because no other tracking station could receive the TV.
I was a little annoyed, because the movie retold history - and effectively took away Honeysuckle's big moment of glory. So I was able to find Honeysuckle's Deputy Director during Apollo 11, Mike Dinn (originally from Leeds I think), and wrote to thank him for the role his team played - even if no-one else remembered it.
Colin Mackellar, Sydney, Australia
I was lucky enough to be sitting on the control console at the Honeysuckle  Creek tracking station near Canberra in Australia on the 21st July 1969 (yes  it was the 21st here).
Born in NW London I emigrated to Australia in 1966 specially to take part in  Apollo and manned and un-manned missions.
I worked the Console as Operations Supervisor for all the Apollo missions, then Skylab and many other  manned missions - the golden years of spaceflight, in my opinion.
We had a visit from the Australian prime minister on the day - otherwise the  mission was similar to many of the simulations (without all the problems  :-).
No time to worry that it was a bit of 20th century history - just that  we didn't make too many mistakes.
It only occurred to me later that we had supplied those first pictures to  the world and that they would eventually become the most requested news clip  of all time.
John Saxon, Australia
I was in Karlsruhe,Germany on a school exchange trip.
There was much excitement about the landing and I was invited to sit with the family and all of their neighbours and friends who had come round to watch the event on their television.
They kept asking me to interpret what had been said and one gentleman repeatedly asked 'Was ist LEM?'
Unfortunately, I had no idea and my German was not up to the task of answering or explaining many of their questions.
I think the overriding emotions were of awe and trepidation.
There had been speculation in the press about what the surface of the moon was like; would it be an immense, deep sea of powder,into which the astronauts would instantly vanish or so hot that it burned the astronauts? Would they ever get home again?
All of these worries tempered the excitement of seeing the event, live, on the flickering television screen. An awesome event that I will never forget.
Peter Webb, UK
I wasn't born in 1969. However, I watched a one-night recap that German TV broadcast, I think it was for the 25th anniversary.
The moon landing has not lost its fascination!
The only thing that made watching the landing a sad thing was the knowledge that the enthusiasm for space exploration seems to have mostly died.
We left Earth, our cradle, took a ""small step"" out onto our front porch, and then crawled back.
There's a whole universe out there to explore. It's time we add more steps and go for an interplanetary walk.

tc_962,What was the profession of Paul Strand (1890 - 1976)?,"Paul Strand (1890-1976) , Tailor's Apprentice, Luzzara, Italy, 1953  | Christie's
Life is not what is invented in ‘stories’; life is another matter.
—Cesare Zavattini
Guided by filmmaker and influential critic Cesare Zavattini, Paul Strand wandered and photographed in Luzzara, Italy as an engaged outsider in search of a subject. Privy to its stories and the lives of its people through the native Zavattini, but unable to speak Italian, Strand beautifully conveys an intimate distance throughout his 1955 photobook Un Paese. The title of the project, ‘Un Paese,’ dually translates to ‘village’ and ‘country,’ as Luzzara along with the young Tailor’s Apprentice featured here, function as both unique individuals and signifiers for the nation and its population experiencing an extraordinary transition following the Second World War.
Like most of his Luzzara subjects, Strand identifies the young woman by her profession rather than by name. Separated from her work environment, clean, well dressed and seemingly content, she is not portrayed as a victim of exploitative mechanized labor so famously documented by Strand’s first photography teacher, Lewis Hine. Hine’s humanitarian documentary projects, particularly his work for the National Child Labor Committee, exude urgency and explicitly encourage social change. Cotton-Mill Worker, North Carolina (1908) confronts the viewer with the stark realities of child labor and poverty, as its young subject meets the gaze of the camera, not unlike the subject of Tailor’s Apprentice, but with a wholly different plea. Hine’s documents advocate, whereas Strand’s portraits illuminate; bringing us closer to the subject without making claim to their personhood. And while Strand’s pristine, precious prints could never be mistaken for one by Hine, Alfred Stieglitz all too often overshadows Hine’s aesthetic influence, even when regarding Strand’s labor oriented images.
Identified as an apprentice, Strand aligns the young girl with an older, more humane system of labor. The text accompanying the photograph and attributed to her reads; ‘I went to Piemonte this year with my mama, who goes there to work as a rice-weeder, because my papa couldn’t stay behind with me since he was alone. There in Piemonte I looked after the landlord’s geese in the pasture.’ In this short note and throughout Un Paese the textural information selected by Strand conveys the facts of life, rather than its stories. The reader learns about the cost of sharpening tools, the loss of life during the war, the expense of marriage, and summers spent with geese while mothers work in fields.
By the late 1940s, the status of the photograph as objective document had been so thoroughly corrupted by its manipulation during the Second World War that artists, photographers, and filmmakers—particularly those in Italy, like Zavattini—embraced and laid claim to the objective subject. In a letter to Beaumont Newhall, dated April 28, 1953, Strand writes about portraiture of subjects ‘completely unknown to the world at large,’ a kind of neo-realist inspired stance that steps away from the candid, documentary impulse to something more intimate and humane. ‘In short there is no necessity to be acquainted with the subject in order to have from the portrait complete esthetic and human satisfaction...I do not say this kind of portraiture invalidates the candid point of view...It is just different, very different and very challenging. It is one thing to photograph people; it is another to make others care about them by revealing the core of their humanness. The old masters did this as though it was the most natural thing to do, and with the greatest simplicity of means.’

Javaka Steptoe
Javaka Steptoe
In 1956, 14 year old James Marshall Hendrix was in his Seattle home, listening to a thunderstorm raging outside. For a moment, he thought he heard a woman's name being blown in the wind— Ten years later, James changed his name to Jimi Hendrix and formed the band, The Experience. When they debuted at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, Hendrix set his guitar on fire and began a new chapter in the history of rock. He died three years later of an accidental drug overdose.
 
Excerpt: 'Jimi: Sounds Like A Rainbow'
The guitarist's story is know to many adult fans. But now, the story of young Jimi Hendrix's is now told in a new children's book by author Gary Golio and illustrator Javaka Steptoe, called ""Jimi Sounds Like a Rainbow: A Story of the Young Jimi Hendrix.""
In addition to writing children's books Gary Golio is a children's therapist. As he tells Weekend Edition Saturday Host Liane Hansen, he feels that telling Hendrix's story to children helps them find their own path.
""Many of the kids I see if I say to them, what do you want to be when you grow up? Alot of them say 'I don't know',"" he says. ""If you don't have a goal as a young person, you're really adrift. Jimi had nothing materially, he was quite poor, but in his imagination, inside of himself, he lived a very rich inner life.
Golio says that there are many important lessons to be learned from the young Jimi Hendrix.
""If you pass through the mythology about him, his childhood reflects all the values that we want to teach our children about. Persistence, and loving what you do, and having goals, positive goals, and investing yourself. That's the way I approached it.""

""It happened when we were both working for RKO in 1943.
I was there briefly before she came out from Illinois. She
certainly made a lasting impression on me. When I left for
service again, I took with me the image of a bright, lovely
and wholesome personality whose charm kept lingering
in my mind. ""
(Raymond Burr, TV Radio Mirror, 1962)
 
Barbara Hale started her career in Hollywood in 1942. Actually, it wasn't her aim to be an actress. She had planned a profession in art.
On April 18, 1922,* Barbara was born in DeKalb, Illinois to parents of Scotch-Irish descent. She was the second child of Willa (born Calvin) and Luther ""Ezra"" Hale, a landscape gardener. Shortly after Barbara's birth, her parents moved to Rockford with her and her elder sister Juanita, who was born in 1913. Here, the actress grew up in a provincial idyll and started to take lessons in ballet and tap dancing at the age of twelve. Barbara also started to participate in local theater plays. Already, during her time in school, she discovered her talent and interest in painting. That's why Barbara decided to enroll in the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts after her graduation from high school in     Rockford. 
Her life in Chicago was more difficult than expected and the competition at the Academy of Fine Arts was huge. Barbara's aim was to work for the advertising industry, but she realized fast that it was a tough business. Thereupon, she started to concentrate on working as a model. She collected first experiences while posing for a comic strip named "" Ramblin'     Bill .""
Shortly after that, Barbara coincidentally met Al Seaman, the head of the Chicago Model Bureau, who was so enthusiastic about his new discovery that he sent photos to RKO Studios. An audition was arranged. Shortly after that, Barbara signed a stock contract and went on to California.
 
Movies
Barely arrived in Hollywood, Barbara first made small appearances in movies. She can be seen as a girl in a bar, a stocking salesgirl, a girl dancing at a party or, as in ""The 7th Victim"" (1943), a witness in the subway.     ( Silent     appearance in ""The 7th Victim"" )
Barbara Hale's first big performance was in ""Higher and Higher"" (1944) at the side of Frank Sinatra. After that, supporting roles followed, for example, in ""The Falcon out West"" (1944) and ""First Yank Into Tokyo"" (1945). Starting from these first successes in B-Movies, she began to steadily establish her reputation. New opportunities for Barbara showed up so that she could prove her talent as an actress. Besides appearing in Westerns like ""West of the Pecos"" (1945), ""Lone Hand"" (1951) and ""Last of the Commanches"" (1952), she also took miscellaneous roles in Dramas and Comedies. For example, one can see her beside James Stewart in ""The Jackpot"" (1950) or with Robert Young in ""Lady Luck"" (1946), where she keeps him busy as his young wife who is skeptical about gambling.
Barbara Hale established her role profile as a warm-hearted, lovable but very strong-minded, vivid and resolute woman who will reach her aim. Mostly, she played women who know what they want and who also show this clearly to the man of their heart. Barbara gave her characters an expressive personality what makes them lovable for viewers. Contributing to that are Barbara's strong charisma on-screen and her warm voice.
Unusual for Barbara Hale was certainly her role as Zoe Crane in ""The Houston Story"" (1956). Not only the appearance of the actress but also Zoe's situation in the plot shows this perfectly. The development of the character seems to follow the classic female part in Film Noir. However, Barbara's role isn't the one of the ""bad girl."" The question if Zoe is possibly a victim in the story stays unanswered.  ( Barbara  in  ""The Houston Story"" .)
Barbara Hale's stock contract with RKO lasted over six years. After that, arrangements with Columbia Studios and other production companies followed.
 
Family
Barbara met her future husband Bill Williams in 1944 during the shooting of ""West of the Pecos."" Later she said that it was love at first sight. Bill Williams was born in Brooklyn on May     21, 1915, and was a dedicated athlete before he moved into Show Business. He began as a dancer in Vaudeville and, in 1944, signed a stock contract at     RKO. Barbara and Bill married in 1946. One year later, on July 24, 1947, her first daughter Barbara Willa Johanna     ('Jody') was born. The small family lived in Los Angeles and Barbara kept on working. The balancing act between job and family was described by her at this time:
 
""It's like walking a tightrope, this business of  career and marriage. I've never walked a tightrope before but I guess I'll have to  learn how."" (RKO Gals,         p773.)
 
On February 16, 1951 Barbara gave birth to son William Theodore.

Katharine Hepburn Won Four Oscars, Never Recevied Them At Show
12:33 PM PST 2/8/2011 by Bill Higgins
COMMENTS
During her 66-year acting career, Katharine Hepburn won four Oscars, but she never came to a ceremony to receive them. “As for me, prizes are nothing,” she once said. “My prize is my work.” Still, four best actress — or actor — awards is an unbeaten feat, akin to Wilt Chamberlain scoring 100 points in an NBA game. Hepburn’s first came for 1933’s Morning Glory, whose title derived from whether her actress character would have a long career or fade “like a morning glory.” And Hepburn’s award winning did fade: She went from a 26-year-old phenom getting a statuette for her third film to being labeled “box-office poison” in a 1938 exhibitors poll.
[pullquote]
During the decades before her next Oscar wins, she made critics swoon over such films as Bringing Up Baby and The Philadelphia Story and swept up a further eight noms. But it was 1967’s Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner, 1968’s The Lion in Winter and 1981’s On Golden Pond that brought Oscars 2, 3 and 4. Hepburn made one appearance, at the 1974 awards presentation; she showed up wearing gardening togs, natch. She presented the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award to producer and friend Lawrence Weingarten. “I’m living proof that a person can wait 41 years to be unselfish,” she said.",Guess Who's Coming To Dinner; Guess Who's Coming To Dinner; Guess who's Coming to Dinner; Guess Who's Coming to Dinner%3F; Guess whose coming to dinner; Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner.,1,1

What is Bungee Jumping?
Share Tweet
Bungee jumping is a recreational sport which involves jumping off from an elevated platform while tied with a big elastic cord. The platform may usually be a fixed object, like any building, tower or bridge, or it may as well be a moving object too, like a hot air balloon or even a helicopter. One end of the elastic cord is tied with the jumper’s body while the other one with the platform. The elastic cord is designed in such a way that it stretches during the jumper’s fall and then rebound repeatedly until all the energy from free fall washed-out. The thrill of this dangerous sport which is coming from the free-fall as much as rebound, made over 2 million people so far to perform the activity since its inception in 1955.
Bungee Jump (Image source: sxc.hu)
The elastic cord can be attached with the jumper in various ways such as in case of body harness, the arms and legs are free to move, and the jumper can spin and flip easily. While in the case of leg harnesses, it is said to be more enjoyable and gives a real feeling of flying.
 
Equipment
The most important equipment for bungee jumping is the elastic cord, which is a factory-produced braided shock cord, consisting of many latex strands encompassed in a tough outer cover. The latex is used to give the bounce on free fall, and the braided cover enables significant durability benefits. Except the cord, there are several other equipment such as the harnesses, various gears and the crane cages.
 
A short history of bungee jumping
Tracking back to the history, the first modern bungee jump was made on April 1979 from the 250-foot tall Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, England by the members of Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club. However, the jumpers got arrested shortly thereafter, but the sport continued with jumps in the US off the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, the latter being sponsored by and televised on the American program dispersing the concept globally. By 1982, they started to jump off from mobile cranes and hot air balloons as well.
 
Bungee at Kawarau Bridge, Image Courtesy – Mat cross at Wikipedia
Commercial bungee jumping began in 1986 with A J Hackett, a New Zealander, who completed his first jump from Auckland’s Greenhithe Bridge. In the subsequent years, Hackett showcased a number of jumps from bridges besides other structures including the Eiffel Tower, developing a public interest in the sport besides opening the world’s foremost permanent commercial bungee site – the Kawarau Bridge Bungee at Queenstown in the South Island of New Zealand. Hackett now continues to be one of the largest commercial operators, with interests in several other countries.

Risk factors
Bungee Jump Risk Factors (Image: morgueFile.com)
In spite of the intrinsic danger of jumping off a great height, numerous million triumphant jumps took place from 1980 onwards. Like any other sports, injuries are possible in bungee jumping but sometimes an improper safety may result even jumper’s death. The safety depends on how well the bungee jumping equipment are maintained and how well the safety factors such as double checking the length calculations as well as fittings of the cord before each jump, is overseen. The major cause of the death or critical injuries is generally due to the equipment failure or miscalculation of the cord length during the sport.
 
There are also some serious health risks which are associated despite all safety measures. One such danger of the sport for women, is risk of uterine prolapse. Due to the speed and pressure that the body faces during the jump, it may result the uterus to slide from its normal position. Eye trauma is also the most frequently reported complication in bungee jumping which may even result in permanent loss of vision. The chances of whiplash injuries are also there as the jumper is jolted on the bungee cord and a very serious injury can also occur if the jumper’s neck or body gets entangled in the cord.","New Zealand; N Z; Nouvelle-Zelande; Kiwiland; New Zealand's; New Zealand.; Nz; New Zealand,; NEW Z; N Zealand; NEW ZEALAND; New Zealend; Administrative divisions of new zealand; New Zaeland; N z; Kiwistan; Enzed; NewZealand; NZ; Name of New Zealand; Staten Landt; New+Zealand; NZL; Nu Tirani; Neo Zealand; ISO 3166-1:NZ; New Zealnd; AoTeAroa; Sheepland; Aotearoa / New Zealand; Subdivisions of New Zealand; Its got that new zeal; New Zealand; Newzealand; New Zeland; New-Zealand; New Zeeland; Administrative divisions of New Zealand; New Zealnad; Staten Land; N.Z.; Staaten land; New.Zealand; Mew Zealand; Maoriland; N.

May 25, 1935: Ruth smashes 3 homers in final hurrah
This article was written by Jack Zerby
The  bedraggled Boston Braves were already in their familiar abode—the  National League cellar—at 8-19 and 11 games out when they played their  28th game of the 1935 season.  The venue was Pittsburgh’s bucolic Forbes  Field; the opponents were the home-standing Pirates.
But the  Braves had Babe Ruth, a free agent newcomer to the National League,  acquired at a high-mileage age 40 by Boston’s owner and erstwhile  manager 1 Judge Emil E. Fuchs 2 when the Yankees cast the legend adrift on February 26.  Although the  Braves already had a “new Babe Ruth,” as writers tabbed popular slugger  Wally Berger 3 , “the Judge liked to take on long-shot comeback players,” 4 and Ruth became “a very big frog in a very small pond” when Fuchs signed him. 5 He’d departed Boston 15 years earlier, when Red Sox owner-theater impresario Harry Frazee sold him to the Yankees.
The  Yankees had scorned Ruth in spring training by re-assigning his uniform  number and using his locker for firewood as prelude to release. 6 Fuchs brought him to Boston in the announced triple capacities of player, second vice president, and assistant manager, 7 but the VP and assistant managerial posts were public relations fluff.  Ruth’s playing days were essentially over, but after banishment by the  Yankees, taking his celebrity to Boston seemed a better option than  retirement.
As the early season progressed, his new pond tended  to engulf the overweight, weak-legged Babe.  He had lifted spirits and  made Fuchs look like a genius with an Opening Day home run at Braves  Field against Giants’ ace Carl Hubbell on April 16. But through May 24  he was hitting just .153 with three home runs and five RBIs, three of  which had come in the opener.
Ruth’s curiosity value had resulted  in his starting 22 of the team’s first 27 games, generally in left  field, although manager Bill McKechnie often lifted him late for a  pinch-runner or defensive replacement.  This day in Pittsburgh, however,  McKechnie had the Babe in his time-honored right field position,  slotted third in the batting order in front of steady producer Berger.
Pirate  manager Pie Traynor started Red Lucas.  The righty was in trouble  before all of the recorded 10,000 in attendance had settled into their  seats on a chilly Saturday afternoon.  Boston shortstop Billy Urbanski  walked and advanced to second on a sacrifice by second baseman Les  Mallon, bringing up Ruth, slugging a paltry .305.  But the Babe, seeing  yet another new National League pitcher, responded with some of his  old-time pizazz and lofted career home run No. 712 into the right field  stands to give the Braves a quick 2-0 edge.  After Berger and first  baseman Randy Moore both singled, Traynor yanked Lucas in favor of  National League veteran Guy Bush, now toiling for Pittsburgh after 12  seasons with the Cubs. Bush induced a double-play grounder off the bat  of left fielder Sheriff Lee to end the inning.
Huck Betts, only  two years Ruth’s junior at 38, was the Boston starter.  He survived two  hits and an error to hold Pittsburgh scoreless in the first, and then  notched a perfect 1-2-3 second inning.
Ruth batted for the second  time in the Braves’ third.  Facing Bush, who had hit him with a pitch  in Game 4 of the 1932 World Series--with Ruth and the Yankees on the way  to a demoralizing sweep of the Cubs--he retaliated with another homer  to right.  The shot, career No. 713, plated Urbanski again and upped the  Braves’ lead to 4-0.
Betts cruised through the third, but his  4-0 lead dissolved into a 4-4 deadlock in the Pittsburgh fourth on RBI  hits by Gus Suhr and Tommy Thevenow and Earl Grace’s sacrifice fly.
Still  in a groove, Ruth added another RBI with a single off Bush in the fifth  to put the Braves back on top, 5-4.  Pittsburgh responded in the bottom  of the inning with three runs on four hits, including an  inside-the-park home run by second baseman Pep Young.  The rally chased  Betts as McKechnie needed Ben Cantwell to record the third out.  The  Pirates now led 7-5.
With that score intact and Bush still  pitching, Ruth came up for the fourth time in the top of the seventh  with one out and the bases empty.  By now the crowd 8 was solidly on the Bambino’s side and rooted enthusiastically for more  of his old magic. The Babe obliged. Career home run No. 714 came on a  3-1 count and bettered the earlier efforts, majestically clearing Forbes  Field’s right field roof—for the first time in the ballpark’s 26-year  history. 9 “The way he smacked it, you knew it was gone.  The crowd just roared,”  Paul Warhola, brother of iconic Pittsburgh pop artist Andy Warhol,  remembered. 10 “He was fat and old but he still had",Boston Braves; Boston Braves (disambiguation); Boston Braves,Pittsburgh Pirates,Pittsburgh Pirates,0,0

Grand Slam History: Wonderful Wimbledon Aces Them All
All the Grand Slams have their history – but nowhere has quite as much as Wimbledon. You can feel it when you walk in. That magic took many years to create. You can’t feel it anywhere else, for all the qualities and diversity of the world’s other venues.
Who would have thought, when the newly-named All England Croquet and Lawn Tennis Club held its inaugural Wimbledon Championship in 1877, that it would be the start of such an incredible journey?
Spencer Gore was the first winner, though Britain’s William Renshaw was the first 19th-Century tennis star, with his seven Wimbledon wins in the 1880s.
Pete Sampras and Roger Federer repeated the feat in the Open era and their task was somewhat harder. Once he became champion, all Renshaw had to do was to turn up for the next final to see off his latest challenger. How times have changed!
The “Other” Opens
It might surprise some to know that the USA started its own national championships as early as 1881, at the Newport Casino, Rhode Island.
The French weren’t far behind in setting up their own national tournament in 1891. And the dawn of the 20th century saw one of their greatest stars – Max Decugis – dominate the scene. Between 1903 and 1914 he won the French title eight times and might have continued his amazing run were it not for the outbreak of the First World War.
By then the Australians were up and running too, their first tournament having taken place in 1905.
The Tournaments Find Their Home Grounds
So which was the first championships to move to its current home? Wimbledon of course, in 1922. The French followed six years later when Roland Garros was established. The US Open didn’t move to Flushing Meadows until 1978, while the Aussie Open only found its current home in 1988.
But the French can boast the first true superstar of the game – Suzanne Lenglen. The world marveled at her grace and talent. She took six top titles in France or Belgium and six more at Wimbledon to capture the hearts of just about every sports fan around.
Then the Brits came up with a superstar of their own. Fred Perry won Wimbledon three times in the 1930s. As we all know, it took until last year for a Brit to win it again. But Perry did something Andy Murray can still only dream about. He became the first player to win the French, Australian and US titles too, all in that same decade.
Amazingly, an American called Maureen Connolly Baker achieved the same feat while she was still a teenager, between 1951 and 1953.
Each country or tournament has its giants. Home-grown Roy Emerson won the Australian six times in the 1960s, while in the Open era Andre Agassi, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic managed such glory four times Down Under.
The Tennis Giants
Wimbledon’s true giants of the Open era haven’t been British. Pete Sampras has won it seven times, along with Federer. Martina Navratilova won Wimbledon an extraordinary nine times. Each champion has been hailed by an adoring British public, which became very used to putting nationality aside during the many years when a Brit couldn’t quite cut it.
US champions William Larned, Richard Sears and Bill Tilden may not be mentioned very often these days; but they took seven singles titles apiece on that side of the Atlantic. Jimmy Connors, Sampras and Federer managed five in the Open era.
It was in 1968 that professionals were finally allowed to join amateurs and do battle at the “Majors.” That’s when the Grand Slam era really began. Few who were already alive will ever forget Arthur Ashe taking the US title and striking a fresh blow for racial equality.
The increased intensity of competition can’t diminish the achievements of someone like Margaret Court, whose career saw out the old and welcomed in the new. She won 24 Slams including eleven Australian, five French, three Wimbledon and five US Open titles. Yet perhaps Steffi Graf’s 22 titles, all won in the Open era, are even more admirable, given the new physical demands of the game.
And Rafael Nadal’s eight Roland Garros titles between 2005 and 2013 had everyone shaking their heads in awe, and wondering how many more he could win.
We know how wonderful the modern era is. We know we are currently watching giants who can be compared favourably against champions of any era. Wimbledon has welcomed these giants down the years, and been enriched by their magnificence. That’s what makes Wimbledon so very special.
You step back in time when you walk through those gates, you can almost touch the all-time greats; yet you are always invited to embrace the present and future too.     
The new Number One Court arrived in 1997, the retractable roof on Centre Court is even more recent and spectacular. Beautiful modern architecture somehow blends perfectly with the traditional feel to the venue. How has Wimbledon moved so stylishly with the times?

Chapter XXVI
The Last Phase
The last phase, marking the period between the German surrender at Reims on 7 May and the dissolution of Supreme Headquarters on 14 July 1945, falls into two periods. The first, which saw the closing out of the former enemy commands, was ended on 5 June when representatives of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States met at Berlin to assume joint authority in Germany for their governments. The second, prolonged until 14 July, consisted of winding up the loose ends of combined responsibilities and preparing the way for a change-over from the Supreme Command to separate national headquarters in western Germany.
During both periods, General Eisenhower found it necessary to play several roles. As U.S. theater commander, he was occupied with the redeployment of U.S. forces to the United States and the Pacific theater. As leader of the victorious armies in the west, he was called on to make numerous appearances in European capitals and at home (he left for the United States on 16 June and did not return until mid-July just before the formal dissolution of SHAEF). As Supreme Commander, he had the task of separating the U.S. and British elements of his combined staff so that an easy transition might be made from an integrated headquarters to separate national forces. Finally, as the representative of his country on the Allied Control Council in Berlin and as commander of U.S. Forces in Germany, he was occupied with tasks of Allied military government, an assignment he delegated in the period covered by this volume to his deputy for military government, Lt. Gen. Lucius D. Clay.
Initial Measures
The Supreme Commander's task in the first weeks after the German surrender consisted of instituting immediate disarmament and control of German forces to prevent the renewal of hostilities, enforcing the terms of surrender by maintaining a strategic air threat and occupying strategic areas on the Continent, establishing law and order as far as possible, and initiating measures to complete the disarmament and control of the German forces. At the same time, he took preliminary steps for the relief and evacuation of Allied prisoners of war and displaced persons and gave such aid to programs for the relief and rehabilitation of liberated countries as did not interfere with military objectives. 1 These tasks continued until control passed from the

Supreme Commander to the quadripartite military government at Berlin or until they were turned over to the national commanders in the French, British, or U.S. zones of occupation. 2
In its initial planning for the occupation of Germany, SHAEF had prepared a number of detailed orders to be presented to the high-level headquarters of the German Army, Navy, and Air Force at the time of surrender.

tc_2202,What are the international registration letters of a vehicle from Iceland?,"Oval car stickers - World Standards
Oval car stickers
Google+3
What’s the deal with those white oval-shaped bumper stickers? Good question!
The usage of these white oval decals originated in Europe in the early 20th century. European countries are relatively small and drivers have always frequently crossed from country to country. Moreover, in those days European licence plates all looked confusingly similar, so Europe needed to find an easy way to identify each vehicle’s country of registration. They came up with the idea of making it mandatory to put a white oval-shaped sticker with black country initials on the back of all vehicles.
This European custom became an international requirement in many countries after the U.N.’s Geneva Convention on Road Traffic (1949) and Vienna Convention on Road Traffic (1968). It was agreed upon that a distinguishing sign of the country of registration had to be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. It also stipulated that the sign could either be placed separately from the registration plate or could be incorporated into the vehicle’s number plate and if the international registration letter was incorporated into the licence plate, it also had to appear on the front number plate.
These days, oval stickers with an international circulation mark are not as common anymore in Europe, since standard E.U. number plates have integrated the country code into a blue strip on the left side of the plate. This blue section is actually the flag of Europe (a circle of 12 yellow stars on a blue background), with the country code of the member state underneath it.
Since only two countries border the United States and the vast majority of Americans, Canadians and Mexicans hire a car instead of bringing their own when they go abroad, there was no need for car ovals at all. This explains why these oval-shaped country stickers have never been subject to any kind of regulation by the American Government. At some point in the early 80s, however, it became trendy for Americans to look European: with the yuppie bimmer craze, it was not uncommon to see BMWs with the German “D” oval sticker (Deutschland) driving on American highways (see picture on the left).
Soon, some Americans started putting all kinds of other stickers on their cars in order to boast about what amazing (European) destinations they had been to. White oval bumper stickers gradually became a fad status symbol, so people started making Euro-looking stickers with abbreviations for places in the States. Common stickers are for instance things like “MV” for Martha’s Vineyard, “CA” for California, “ACK” for Nantucket (which is the airport code) and “OBX” for the Outer Banks of North Carolina.

Was Dr Crippen innocent of his wife's murder?
29 July 2010
Close share panel

Hawley Crippen, the doctor hanged for the gruesome murder of his wife Cora, is one of the most infamous killers in British history. Exactly 100 years after his arrest, why is there a campaign to prove his innocence, asks Stephen Tomkins?
Having the surname Crippen does not endear you to UK Customs, according to a distant relative of the infamous doctor convicted of killing his wife.
James Patrick Crippen of Ohio, second cousin three times removed of Dr Hawley Crippen, hopes to officially exonerate the black sheep of the family and bring his remains to the family plot in Michigan for a decent burial.
""The evidence says the man should be pardoned,"" he says. ""But everyone thinks of him as a murderer. Every time I have come through customs to England, someone has made a comment on my name, linking me to a murderer.""
Crippen rose to infamy by allegedly poisoning and dismembering his wife, hiding her remains under the basement floor, and fleeing for North America with his lover - and then being the first person to be caught using the wireless telegraph.
The message was sent 100 years ago, and Crippen was arrested on arrival in Quebec on 31 July, 1910. His trial lasted only five days, and the jury's deliberations for less than half an hour.
The role of wireless radio
Captain Henry Kendall saw through  Crippen's disguise as the doctor boarded his ship with his lover dressed as a boy
The SS Montrose was one of very few Canadian Pacific liners fitted with a Marconi wireless radio
Kendall had the operator wire the White Star Line Offices in London
The message read: ""Have strong suspicions that Crippen - London cellar murderer and accomplice are among Saloon passengers. Moustache taken off - growing beard. Accomplice dressed as boy. Voice manner and build undoubtedly a girl.""
British police caught a faster ship to Quebec and were there for Crippen's arrival
The torso was identified as Cora Crippen's by a scar, the doctor was shown to have bought a large amount of the drug that killed her, and on his arrest he told Chief Inspector Dew: ""I am not sorry; the anxiety has been too much.""
The mild-mannered murderer became a national celebrity and his waxwork stands in Madame Tussauds to this day. But was it all a huge miscarriage of justice? Was Crippen innocent after all? A growing body of people believe so, including family members and forensic scientists, and a campaign is under way to clear his name.
One line of evidence comes from John Trestrail, a toxicologist who has long puzzled over the mutilation of the corpse. The remains found were a torso without bones or sex organs.
Mutilation is extremely unusual behaviour among poisoners, Mr Trestrail says. ""A poisoner wants the death to appear natural so he can get a death certificate. This is the only case I know of where the victim was dismembered. It doesn't make sense.""
'He finally cracked'
Mr Trestrail brought in Professor David Foran, director of forensic science at Michigan State University, who led DNA analysis on the scarred skin of the corpse used in the trial. It was demanding work over two years, retrieving tissue preserved in formaldehyde from the glass slide it was attached to with pine resin.

Image caption Crippen's house in north London has since been demolished
Mr Foran followed two lines of research and considers the results conclusive. First he isolated mitochondrial DNA, which remains unchanged throughout the generations down the female line. A genealogist found grandnieces of Cora Crippen who would have the same mitochondrial DNA as her, and repeated tests found they were not related to the body in the basement.
Then Mr Foran's team used new techniques to examine the nuclear DNA, and discovered a Y chromosome. Not only was the body not from Cora Crippen's family, it wasn't even a woman.
As Mr Trestrail sums it up, ""This is the slide which Spilsbury [the expert witness at the trial] used to identify the body as Cora Crippen's. And this was the evidence on which Crippen was convicted. But the substance in the slide is not Cora Crippen. No question. I don't say Hawley Crippen is innocent, but he is no longer proven guilty.""
Not everyone is convinced, however. John Boyne, whose book Crippen: A Novel of Murder, is to be reissued next year, says: ""I think Crippen probably did kill his wife. His actions suggest guilt - his decision to flee the country and to dress Ethel LeNeve as his son rather than allow her to reveal her true identity on the ship as his lover. Cora made his life so miserable that I think he finally cracked.""
I have no interest in clearing Crippen's name. What I care about is being right

tc_2306,Who did Jack Ruby shoot in November 1963?,"Jack Ruby - Facts & Summary - HISTORY.com
Google
Who Was Jack Ruby?
Jacob Rubenstein, later known as Jack Ruby, was born in Chicago in 1911, the son of Polish immigrants. Official records list conflicting dates for Ruby’s birth; however, he used March 25, 1911, on his driver’s license.
Did You Know?
In 2009, the gray fedora worn by Jack Ruby when he shot Lee Harvey Oswald sold for $53,775 at a Dallas auction. The shackles Ruby wore when dying at Dallas’ Parkland Memorial Hospital sold for over $11,000, while an X-ray of Ruby's head went for more than $700.
Ruby, one of eight siblings, had a troubled childhood in Chicago and spent time in foster care. He never graduated from high school and spent years working odd jobs, including as a door-to-door salesman and ticket scalper. During World War II , Ruby served in the Army Air Forces, working as an aircraft mechanic at U.S. bases. By the late 1940s, he had moved to Dallas, where he became a small-time operator in the world of nightclubs and gambling. He also racked up a series of arrests for minor offenses.
Ruby had fringe connections to organized crime and a reputation as a name-dropper and publicity seeker. He never married and possessed no known political affiliations.
The Kennedy Assassination
On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline (1929-1994) were riding with Texas Governor John Connally (1917-1993) and his wife in an open limousine in a presidential motorcade through downtown Dallas. As their vehicle passed the Texas School Book Depository Building at 12:30 p.m., Lee Harvey Oswald, who had started working at the building the previous month, allegedly fired three shots from the sixth floor, fatally wounding the 46-year-old president and seriously injuring Governor Connally. Kennedy was pronounced dead 30 minutes later at Dallas’ Parkland Memorial Hospital. Less than an hour after Kennedy was shot, Oswald killed a policeman, J.D. Tippit (1924-1963), who questioned him on the street near his Dallas rooming house. A short time later, police arrested Oswald, a Louisiana native and ex-Marine who lived for a time in the Soviet Union, at a movie theater. He denied killing Tippit and Kennedy, but was soon arraigned on charges of murdering both men.
Jack Ruby Kills Lee Harvey Oswald
On November 24, a crowd of reporters, policemen and camera crews gathered to watch as Oswald was brought to the basement of the Dallas city jail en route to a waiting car scheduled to transfer him to the county jail. As a handcuffed Oswald, flanked by detectives, came into view, Jack Ruby, stocky, balding and wearing a dark suit and gray fedora, lunged forward from the crowd. At approximately 11:20 a.m., Ruby fatally wounded Oswald with a single shot to the abdomen from a concealed .38-caliber Colt Cobra revolver. Television cameras captured the attack, which was witnessed live by Americans across the country. The shooter, wrestled to the ground by police, shouted, “You all know me. I’m Jack Ruby.”Oswald was rushed to Parkland Hospital, where he soon died in surgery. Ruby, charged with murder, claimed he killed Oswald so Jacqueline Kennedy wouldn’t have to return to Dallas for a trial.
Jack Ruby’s Conviction and Death
At his high-profile trial, Jack Ruby was defended pro bono by prominent California attorney Melvin Belli (1907-1996), who argued that psychomotor epilepsy had caused Ruby to mentally black out and subconsciously shoot Oswald, and that due to this condition he should be treated with leniency. However, on March 14, 1964, after deliberating for just over two hours, a jury found Ruby guilty of murder with malice and sentenced him to death by the electric chair. Belli expressed outrage at the verdict and claimed that Ruby, a Jew, was a victim of discrimination.In October 1966, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the conviction on the grounds of improper admission of testimony and the fact that Ruby could not have received a fair trial in Dallas at the time due to excessive publicity. A new trial was scheduled to take place in Wichita Falls, Texas, in February 1967. However, on December 9, 1966, Ruby was admitted to Parkland Hospital (the same place where Kennedy and Oswald had died) with pneumonia. Soon after, he was diagnosed with lung cancer. On January 3, 1967, he died at age 55 from a blood clot in his lung.
What Motivated Jack Ruby?
Some people lauded Jack Ruby as a hero for killing the president’s alleged assassin, while others believed he murdered Oswald to keep him from revealing a larger conspiracy. Ruby contended he had acted impulsively out of grief and denied being part of any conspiracy. (Life magazine reported that Ruby often carried a handgun and that, on the day of the Oswald murder, the nightclub owner had left his dog in the car outside the police building as if he planned to return shortly.) Other explanations for Ruby’s actions have been suggested, including the idea that he wanted to be a hero, that he was under the influe",Lee Harvey Oswald; Oswald the Lone Assassin; Lone Nut Theory; Lone gunman; Lee Oswald; Lee H.

Khyber Pass, Khyber also spelled Khaybar, orKhaibar,  most northerly and important of the passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan . The pass connects Kābul with Peshāwar . The pass has historically been the gateway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent from the northwest. The name Khyber is also applied to the range of arid, broken hills through which the pass runs and which form the last spurs of the Spin Ghar (Safīd Kūh) Range. On either side of the connecting ridge are the sources of two small streams, the beds of which form the Khyber gorge. This narrow gorge forms the Khyber Pass; it winds between cliffs of shale and limestone, 600–1,000 feet (180–300 m) high, and enters the Khyber Hills from the Shadi Bagiār opening, a few miles beyond Jamrūd , Pak., and continues northwestward for about 33 miles (53 km). Just beyond the old Afghan fort of Haft Chāh, it opens onto the barren Lowyah Dakkah plain, which stretches to the Kābul River .
Khyber Pass, Pakistan
Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.
After a steep ascent at its southern entrance, the pass rises gradually to Fort Ali Masjid (3,174 feet), where the Khyber River (Khyber Khwār) leaves the pass to the south. For 5 miles from Ali Masjid the pass becomes a defile not more than 600 feet wide, flanked by imposing and precipitous walls. From Zīntara village on northward, the pass becomes a valley a mile or more wide, with forts, villages, and scattered cultivation plots. About 10 miles west of Ali Masjid lies Landi Kotal fort and cantonment (3,518 feet); this is the highest point in the pass and is also an important market centre with an alternate route back to Peshāwar. There the summit widens out northward for 2 miles. The main pass, however, descends from Landi Kotal through Shinwārī territory to Landi Khāna, where it runs through another gorge and enters Afghanistan territory at Towr Kham (Torkham; 2,300 feet), winding another 10 miles down the valley to Lowyah Dakkah.

The Khyber Pass is threaded by a caravan track and by a good hard-surface road. The railway (opened 1925) through the pass connects Jamrūd with Landi Khāna, near the Afghan frontier; the line, with its 34 tunnels and 94 bridges and culverts, revolutionized transportation in the area. The pass may be skirted by a road fork that enters the hills about 9 miles north of Jamrūd and emerges at Lowyah Dakkah.
Few passes have had such continuing strategic importance or so many historic associations as the Khyber Pass. Through it have passed Persians, Greeks, Mughals, Afghans, and the British, for whom it was the key point in control of the Afghan border. In the 5th century bc Darius I the Great of Persia conquered the country around Kābul and marched through the Khyber Pass to the Indus River . Two centuries later Hephaestion and Perdiccas, generals of Alexander the Great , probably used the pass. Buddhism flourished in and around the Khyber when it was part of Aśoka’s kingdom (3rd century bc); Buddhist remains include Kāfir Kot (Citadel of the Kafirs), Shopla stūpa (also called the Khyber Top), and the stūpa near Ali Masjid. The pass was used by Maḥmūd of Ghazna , Bābur, Nāder Shāh , and Aḥmad Shāh Durrānī and his grandson Shāh Zamān in their invasions of India. Ranjit Singh , the Sikh ruler of the Punjab, extended his kingdom as far as Jamrūd in the early 19th century.
The Pashtun Afrīdī people of the Khyber area always resisted foreign control, and numerous punitive expeditions were undertaken against them by the Mughals and the British. The first British advance northward into the Khyber took place in 1839, and during the First Anglo-Afghan War the pass was the scene of many skirmishes with the Afridis. The Treaty of Gandamak , which was signed during the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879, left the Khyber tribes under British control. In 1897 the Afridis seized the pass and held it for several months but were defeated in the Tīrāh expedition of 1897. The British became responsible for the safety of the pass, which is now controlled by the Pakistani Khyber Agency.

""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."" -- Albert Einstein
Photosynthesis
An Understandable (Not Necessarily Easy) Approach...
Pinus palustris -- Pearson Creek
(it will take some time to understand this; read deliberately and understand what you have read before going on to the next paragraphs)
Photosynthesis is defined as the formation of carbohydrates in living plants from water and carbon dioxide (CO2). It is the most important chemical pathway (series of chemical reactions) on our planet. Almost all of the biomass on Earth was initially created by photosynthesis.
Each year 100 quadrillion (or 10 to the 17th) Kilocalories (K.cal.) of useful energy are produced by photosynthesis (about 100 times more energy than is consumed by burning of fossil fuels). At least half of the photosynthesis in the world takes place in oceans, lakes and rivers, brought about by many different microorganisms that constitute the phytoplankton.
All organisms on Earth can be classified on the basis of two fundamental physiologic requirements:
(A) Energy source:
(1) use sunlight for energy: Phototrophs.
(2) use chemical compounds for energy : Chemotrophs
(B) Carbon source:
(1) source is CO2: Autotrophs.
(2) source is chemical compounds: Heterotrophs
Chemoautotrophs (use chemical compounds for energy and CO2 for carbon) -- bacteria (some)
Chemoheterotrophs (use chemical compounds for both energy and carbon) -- animals
Photoaututrophs (use sunlight for energy and CO2 for carbon) -- plants and photosynthetic bacteria
Photoaututrophs utilize sunlight for energy and CO2 for their carbon source by this process of PHOTOSYNTHESIS whereby sunlight is absorbed by a complex compound known as chlorophyll and converted to energy which drives a series of chemical reactions that ultimately removes hydrogen from water or other compounds and then combines the hydrogen with carbon dioxide in a way that produces sugars.
Photosynthetic organisms can be divided into two classes: those which produce oxygen and those which do not. Photosynthetic bacteria do not produce oxygen (in fact some of them called anaerobes cannot tolerate oxygen) and this is considered a more primitive type of photosynthesis (in which the hydrogen donor is hydrogen sulfide, lactate or other compounds, but not water). Plants and one type of bacteria (cyanobacteria) do produce oxygen, an evolutionarily more advanced type of photosynthesis (in which the hydrogen donor is water).
In a broad chemical sense, the opposite of photosynthesis is respiration. Most of life on this planet (all except in the deep sea vents) depends on the reciprocal photosynthesis-driven production of carbon containing compounds by a series of reducing (adding electrons) chemical reactions carried out by plants and then the opposite process of oxidative (removing electrons) chemical reactions by animals (and plants, which are capable of both photosynthesis and respiration) in which these carbon compounds are broken down to carbon dioxide and water.
The oxidative chemical reactions of respiration release energy, some of which is heat and some of it is captured in the form of high energy compunds such as Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and Nicotinamide adenide dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). These compounds have a high energy (unstable) terminal phosphate bond and that terminal phosphate is easily detached with the transfer of the energy to drive chemical reactions in the synthesis of other biomolecules. In this case, the ATP loses one phosphate to become the energy-depleted ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and the NADPH loses one electron to become energy-depleted NADP+.
Photosynthesis converts these energy- depleted compounds (ADP and NADP+) back to the high energy forms (ATP and NADPH) and the energy thus produced in this chemical form is utilized to drive the chemical reactions necessary for synthesis of sugars and other carbon containing compounds (e.g., proteins, fats). The production of high energy ATP and NADPH in plants occurs in what is known as Light Phase Reactions (Z Scheme) (requires sunlight). The energy releasing reactions which converts them back to energy-depleted ADP and NADP is known as Dark Phase Reactions (Calvin Cycle) (does not require light) in which the synthesis of glucose and other carbohydrates occurs.
 
 
So we can summarize by saying that the photosynthetic plants trap solar energy to form ATP and NADPH (Light Phase) and then use these as the energy source to make carbohydrates and other biomolecules from carbon dioxide and water (Dark Phase), simultaneously releasing oxygen in to the atmosphere. The chemoheterotrophic animals reverse this process by using the oxygen to degrade the energy-rich organic products of photosynthesis to CO2 and water in order to generate ATP for their own synthesis of biomolecules.
Plant photosynthesis, both the Light Phase and Dark phase reactions, takes place in chloroplasts, which may be regarded as the ""power plant",Chlorophyll; C55H70O6N4Mg; Chlorophyll; Chorophyll; C55H72O5N4Mg; Chlorophyl; Chlorophylls; Chlorophyllose; Chlorafil; E140 (E number); Chlorophyllous; C35H30O5N4Mg; Leaf-green; Clorophyl; C54H70O6N4Mg; Chlorophil; Clorofill; Leafgreen; Cholorophyll; Cholorophyl; Leaf green; C35H28O5N4Mg,Chlorophyll,Chlorophyll.,1,1

Our Pacemaker Main Article provides a comprehensive look at the who, what, when and how of Pacemaker
Definition of Pacemaker
Take the Heart Disease Quiz!
Pacemaker: A system that  sends electrical impulses to the heart in order to set the  heart rhythm. The pacemaker can be the normal ""natural"" pacemaker of the heart or it can be an electronic device.
The natural pacemaker of the heart is the sinus node , one of the major elements in the cardiac conduction system , the system that controls the heart rate . This stunningly designed system generates electrical impulses and conducts them throughout the muscle of the heart, stimulating the heart to contract and pump blood.
The sinus node consists of a cluster of cells that are situated in the upper part of the wall of the right atrium (the right upper chamber of the heart). The electrical impulses are generated there. The sinus node is also called the sinoatrial node or, for short, the SA node .
The electrical signal generated by the sinus node moves from cell to cell down through the heart until it reaches the atrioventricular node ( AV node ), a cluster of cells situated in the center of the heart between the atria and ventricles. The AV node serves as a gate that slows the electrical current before the signal is permitted to pass down through to the ventricles. This delay ensures that the atria have a chance to fully contract before the ventricles are stimulated. After passing the AV node, the electrical current travels to the ventricles along special fibers embedded in the walls of the lower part of the heart.
Although there are different types of artificial  pacemakers, all are designed to treat bradycardia , a heart  rate that is too slow. Some pacemakers function  continuously and stimulate the heart at a fixed rate or at  an increased rate during exercise. A pacemaker can also be  programmed to detect an overly long pause between  heartbeats, and then stimulate the heart. For more information, see Artificial pacemaker .

New, smaller moons are being discovered all the time with recent space missions.  The total count of moons (as of 12/18/2001) are:
Mercury - 0 moons      Mars    -  2 moons   Uranus - 20 moons       Venus   - 0 moons      Jupiter - 28 moons   Neptune - 8 moons        Earth   - 1 moon       Saturn  - 30 moons   Pluto -   1 moon
Moons range in shape from highly irregular to spheres.  Their shape reflects their formation history, irregular objects are ill-formed moons (captured asteroids or comets) or pieces of a larger moon, spherical objects were once molten spheres, probably at the time of their formation.
Moons of Mars:
Deimos & Phobos
We speculate, from their irregular appearances and low mean densities, that Deimos and Phobos, are captured asteroids.  Both Deimos and Phobos are saturated with craters.  Deimos has a smoother appearance caused by partial filling of some of its craters.
Moons of Jupiter:
Jupiter has 63 confirmed moons as of Jan 2009, i.e. moons with known orbits around Jupiter.  Eight of these moons are regular, meaning they have prograde, nearly circular orbits.  They are composed of the four Galilean satellites, plus the inner or Amalthea group:
Adrastea is a typical small moon
Metis is the innermost known satellite of Jupiter
Amalthea is one of Jupiter's smaller, irregular moons, an example of moon collecting dust from another moon (Io)
The remaining 55 moons are irregular, they have a mixture of prograde and retrograde orbits with high inclinations and eccentricities.  Jupiter's regular satellites are believed to have formed from a circumplanetary disk, a ring of accreting gas and solid debris analogous to a protoplanetary disk.
The irregular satellites are substantially smaller objects with more distant and eccentric orbits. They form families with shared similarities in orbit (semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity) and composition; it is believed that these are at least partially collisional families that were created when larger (but still small) parent bodies were shattered by impacts from asteroids captured by Jupiter's gravitational field.
Moons of Saturn:
The moons of Saturn are numerous and diverse, ranging from tiny moonlets less than 1 kilometer across to the enormous Titan, which is larger than the planet Mercury. Saturn has sixty-two moons with confirmed orbits, fifty-three of which have names, and only thirteen of which have diameters larger than 50 kilometers.  Saturn has seven moons that are large enough to become spherical.
Twenty-four of Saturn's moons are regular satellites; they have prograde orbits not greatly inclined to the Saturn's equatorial plane. These include the seven major satellites, four small moons which exist in a Trojan orbit with larger moons, two mutually co-orbital moons and two moons which act as shepherds of Saturn's F Ring. Two other known regular satellites orbit within gaps in Saturn's rings. The relatively large Hyperion is locked in a resonance with Titan. The remaining regular moons orbit near the outer edge of the A Ring, within G Ring and between the major moons Mimas and Enceladus. The regular satellites are traditionally named after Titans and Titanesses or other figures associated with the mythological Saturn.
The remaining thirty-eight, all small except one, are irregular satellites, whose orbits are much farther from Saturn, have high inclinations, and are mixed between prograde and retrograde. These moons are probably captured minor planets, or debris from the breakup of such bodies after they were captured, creating collisional families. The irregular satellites have been classified by their orbital characteristics into the Inuit, Norse, and Gallic groups, and their names are chosen from the corresponding mythologies.

A Brief History of Animals in Space
Before humans actually went into space, one of the prevailing theories of the perils of space flight was that humans might not be able to survive long periods of weightlessness. For several years, there had been a serious debate among scientists about the effects of prolonged weightlessness. American and Russian scientists utilized animals - mainly monkeys, chimps and dogs - in order to test each country's ability to launch a living organism into space and bring it back alive and unharmed.
On June 11, 1948, a V-2 Blossom launched into space from White Sands, New Mexico carrying Albert I, a rhesus monkey. Lack of fanfare and documentation made Albert an unsung hero of animal astronauts. On June 14, 1949, a second V-2 flight carrying a live Air Force Aeromedical Laboratory monkey, Albert II, attained an altitude of 83 miles. The monkey died on impact. On August 31, 1950, another V-2 was launched and carried an unanaesthetized mouse that was photographed in flight and did not survive impact. On December 12, 1949, the last V-2 monkey flight was launched at White Sands. Albert IV, a rhesus monkey attached to monitoring instruments, was the payload. It was a successful flight, with no ill effects on the monkey until impact, when it died.
On September 20, 1951, a monkey named Yorick and 11 mice were recovered after an Aerobee missile flight of 236,000 feet at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico. Yorick got a fair amount of press as the first monkey to live through a space flight.
On May 22, 1952, two Philippine monkeys, Patricia and Mike, were enclosed in an Aerobee nose section at Holloman Air Force Base. Patricia was placed in a seated position and Mike in a prone position to determine differences in the effects of rapid acceleration. Fired 36 miles up at a speed of 2000 mph, these two monkeys were the first primates to reach such a high altitude. Also on this flight were two white mice, Mildred and Albert. They were inside a slowly rotating drum where they could ""float"" during the period of weightlessness. The section containing the animals was recovered safely from the upper atmosphere by parachute. Patricia died of natural causes about two years later and Mike died in 1967, both at the National Zoological Park in Washington, DC.
The Soviets kept close tabs on what the U.S. was doing with their V-2 and Aerobee missile projects during the early 1950's. Basing their experiments on American biomedical research, Soviet rocket pioneer Sergei Korolev, his biomedical expert Vladimir Yazdovsky, and a small team used mice, rats and rabbits as one-way passengers for their initial tests. They needed to gather data to design a cabin to carry a human being into space. Eventually they chose small dogs for this phase of testing. Dogs were chosen over monkeys because it was felt that they would be less fidgety in flight. A test with two dogs would allow for more accurate results. They chose females because of the relative ease of controlling waste.
Between 1951 and 1952, the Soviet R-1 series rockets carried nine dogs altogether, with three dogs flying twice. Each flight carried a pair of dogs in hermetically sealed containers that were recovered by parachute. Of these early space-bound hounds, a few have been remembered by name.
On August 15, 1951, Dezik and Tsygan (""Gypsy"") were launched. These two were the first canine suborbital astronauts. They were successfully retrieved. In early September 1951, Dezik and Lisa were launched. This second early Russian dog flight was unsuccessful. The dogs died but a data recorder survived. Korolev was devastated by the loss of these dogs. Shortly afterwards, Smelaya (""Bold"") and Malyshka (""Little One"") were launched. Smelaya ran off the day before the launch. The crew was worried that wolves that lived nearby would eat her. She returned a day later and the test flight resumed successfully. The fourth test launch was a failure, with two dog fatalities. However, in the same month, the fifth test launch of two dogs was successful. On September 15, 1951, the sixth of the two-dog launches occurred. One of the two dogs, Bobik, escaped and a replacement was found near the local canteen. She was a mutt, given the name ZIB, the Russian acronym for ""Substitute for Missing Dog Bobik."" The two dogs reached 100 kilometers and returned successfully. Other dogs associated with this series of flights included Albina (""Whitey""), Dymka (""Smoky""), Modnista (""Fashionable""), and Kozyavka (""Gnat"").
On November 3rd, 1957, Sputnik 2 blasted into Earth orbit with a dog named Laika aboard. Laika, which is Russian for ""Husky"" or ""Barker,"" had the real name of Kudryavka (""Little Curly""). In the U.S. she was eventually dubbed ""Muttnik."" Laika was a small, stray mongrel picked up from the street. She was hastily trained and put aboard in a metal carrier under the second Sputnik sphere. There was no time to work out any reentry strategy and Laika expired after a ",Mice; 🐁; Mouse subgenus; Reproductive behavior of mice; Mouse (animal); MOUSE; Mouse (rodent); 🐭; Mus (genus); Mice; Mouse,Laska,Benjy and Laska.,0,0

History
The world's first underground railway, between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street was opened by the Metropolitan Railway on 10th January 1863. The initial section was six km (nearly four miles) in length, and with trains hauled by steam engines provided both a new commuter rail service and an onward rail link for passengers arriving at Paddington, Euston and King's Cross main line stations to the City of London.
By the end of 1868 another company, the Metropolitan District, had opened a line between Westminster and South Kensington, where it linked up with a branch line built by the Metropolitan Railway from Edgware Road. Extensions eastwards by both the District and the Metropolitan enabled the Circle Line of today to be completed by 1884. All these lines were built by the cut and cove method, which involved excavating a trench - usually in the middle of a roadway - then covering the tracks with a brick-lined tunnel and finally restoring the surface.
By the end of the 19th century, the cut and cover system had been abandoned in central London because of the disruption and traffic congestion it caused during construction. But in the suburbs and further afield, the Metropolitan Railway had been extended by 1900 out across Middlesex and through Hertfordshire into Buckinghamshire to Aylesbury.
The oldest section of today's Underground in fact predates the Metropolitan Railway by 20 years. The Thames Tunnel between Rotherhithe and Wapping, the first such structure under water anywhere in the world, was built by Sir Marc Brunel and his famous son, Isambard. The method they adopted was similar to coal mining, sinking vertical shafts and then excavating the tunnels from within a metal shield. It is a tribute to the Brunels that major refurbishment to the tunnel fabric was only needed during 1990s. Although it was designed for horse-drawn traffic, it opened in 1843 for pedestrians only, became a railway tunnel in 1869 and now carries the East London Line under the Thames. In 1870, another railway under the Thames opened with a cable-hauled line between the Tower of London and Bermondsey. That venture was no more successful in its original guise than the Thames Tunnel, and was converted for pedestrian use after just a few months (and closed altogether when Tower Bridge opened in 1894).
Once the cut and cover system of construction had been abandoned, new lines from the 1880s in central London and the inner suburbs have been built in twin tunnels some 20 metres underground, where a layer of clay made excavation relatively simple. The first such line was the City and South London Railway, which ran for 5.2 km (3.25 miles) from King William Street in the City under the Thames to Stockwell. This was planned as a cable-hauled railway, but it opened in1890 as the world's first deep-level electric railway. This and subsequent similar lines have since always been known as tube railways.
The Waterloo & City Railway, also passing under the River, opened in 1898, followed two years later by the Central London Railway, known as the “Two-penny Tube"", from Shepherd's Bush to the Bank. Its popular name came from its fare of 2d (just under 1p) for any length of journey. Early this century, three American-financed tubes were built. The Baker Street & Waterloo Railway (soon abbreviated to “Bakerloo"") opened in 1906; the Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (also opened in 1906, and now part of the Piccadilly line); and the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway (opened in 1907, and now part of the Northern line).
The Underground expanded rapidly between the wars, reaching Ealing Broadway in 1920, Edgware in 1924 and Morden in 1926. 1932 and 1933 saw the Piccadilly extended to Uxbridge and Cockfosters, and the District to Upminster. The Metropolitan reached Watford in 1925 and Stanmore in 1932.
A single authority, never officially but always popularly known as London Transport, was set up in 1933 and immediately began formulating plans to expand the Underground further both by building new extensions and by incorporating existing suburban lines. However the 1939-1945 war intervened, and eight km (five miles) of tunnel on the uncompleted eastern extension of the Central line even became an underground aircraft component factory.
Many tube stations were used as shelters during bombing raids. After the war, the Central line scheme was completed, with the new tunnels to Newbury Park opening in 1947, and the extensions to West Ruislip and Epping opening in 1948 and 1949 respectively.
The first new tube line in central London since 1907, the Victoria Line, was opened in 1969, with the southern extension to Brixton following in 1971. In December 1977 an extension of the Piccadilly line beyond Hounslow West to Heathrow Airport was opened, and a further single-track loop to serve the airport's new Terminal 4 opened in 1986.

qz_430,What are the only two musical notes which have no flats?,"Key Signature in Music Notation & Musical Staff
musictheory 0 Comment
The key signature at the beginning of a musical staff lists the sharps or flats in the key.
In musical notation, a key signature is a series of sharp symbols or flat symbols placed on the staff, designating notes that are to be consistently played one semitone higher or lower than the equivalent natural notes (for example, the white notes on a piano keyboard) unless otherwise altered with an accidental. Key signatures are generally written immediately after the clef at the beginning of a line of musical notation, although they can appear in other parts of a score, notably after a double bar.
The key signature comes right after the clef symbol on the staff. It may have either some sharp symbols on particular lines or spaces, or some flat symbols, again on particular lines or spaces. If there are no flats or sharps listed after the clef symbol, then the key signature is “all notes are natural”.
In common notation, clef and key signature are the only symbols that must appear on every staff. They appear so often because they are such important symbols; they tell you what note is on each line and space of the staff. The clef tells you the letter name of the note (A, B, C, etc.), and the key tells you whether the note is sharp, flat or natural.
The key signature is a list of all the sharps and flats in the key that the music is in. When a sharp (or flat) appears on a line or space in the key signature, all the notes on that line or space are sharp (or flat), and all other notes with the same letter names in other octaves are also sharp (or flat).
This key signature has a flat on the “B” line, so all of these B’s are flat.
The sharps or flats always appear in the same order in all key signatures. This is the same order in which they are added as keys get sharper or flatter. For example, if a key (G major or E minor) has only one sharp, it will be F sharp, so F sharp is always the first sharp listed in a sharp key signature.
The keys that have two sharps (D major and B minor) have F sharp and C sharp, so C sharp is always the second sharp in a key signature, and so on. The order of sharps is: F sharp, C sharp, G sharp, D sharp, A sharp, E sharp, B sharp. The order of flats is the reverse of the order of sharps: B flat, E flat, A flat, D flat, G flat, C flat, F flat. So the keys with only one flat (F major and D minor) have a B flat; the keys with two flats (B flat major and G minor) have B flat and E flat; and so on. The order of flats and sharps, like the order of the keys themselves, follows a circle of fifths.
The key signatures with seven flats and seven sharps are very rarely used, not only because pieces in these “extreme” sharp or flat keys are more difficult to play on most instruments, but also because they have simpler enharmonic equivalents. For example, the key of C# major (seven sharps) is more simply represented as Db major (five flats). For modern practical purposes these keys are the same, because C# and Db are the same note. Pieces are written in these “extreme” sharp or flat keys, however: for example, Bach’s Prelude and Fugue No. 3 from Book 1 of The Well Tempered Clavier BWV 848 is in C# major.
If you do not know the name of the key of a piece of music, the key signature can help you find out. Assume for a moment that you are in a major key. If the key contains sharps, the name of the key is one half step higher than the last sharp in the key signature. If the key contains flats, the name of the key signature is the name of the second-to-last flat in the key signature.
Example 1
The only major keys that these rules do not work for are C major (no flats or sharps) and F major (one flat). It is easiest just to memorize the key signatures for these two very common keys. If you want a rule that also works for the key of F major, remember that the second-to-last flat is always a perfect fourth higher than (or a perfect fifth lower than) the final flat. So you can also say that the name of the key signature is a perfect fourth lower than the name of the final flat.
If the music is in a minor key, it will be in the relative minor of the major key for that key signature. If you cannot tell from the sound of the music if you are in a major or minor key, the best clue is to look at the final chord. That chord (and often the final note of the melody, also) will usually name the key. Problem 1 Write the following key signatures correctly and name the major keys that they represent:
However, the aforementioned 15 key signatures only express diatonic scales (and are therefore sometimes called “standard key signatures”). Other scales are written either with a standard key signature and use accidentals as required, or with a non-standard key signature, such as the Eb (right hand) and F# & G# (left hand) used for the Eb diminished (Eb octatonic) scale in Bartók’s “Crossed Hands” (no. 99, vol. 4, Mikrokosmos), or the Bb, Eb & F# used for the D ",C and F; C and F,C and F,C and F.,1,1

Film Review: A Study In Terror (1965)
Nigel Honeybone 07/20/2013 Film Reviews
SYNOPSIS:
“Jack The Ripper is on the loose killing prostitutes in London’s Whitechapel district and Sherlock Holmes, assisted by his friend Doctor Watson, is on the case. From the pathologist’s findings. Holmes concludes that the man had some medical training, most likely as a surgeon. Various clues lead him to the son of an aristocrat who was studying medicine but has since vanished since marrying a prostitute. His investigation leads him to a local street mission for the poor where Doctor Murray, an avowed socialist who works part-time as a police surgeon, does his best to provide the basic necessities of life to London’s poor and destitute. Holmes soon has a short list of possible suspects including Doctor Murray, his assistant Sally Young and Max Steiner, a pub owner and pimp. The inevitable final confrontation reveals the identity of the killer.” (courtesy IMDB)
REVIEW:
The sixties brought a wind of change in the cinema and permissiveness raised its head. From the almost naive self-conscious flashes of bosom and veiled references to sex in the early sixties, we moved to flaunted full-frontals and explicit sexual simulation in the late sixties and to this day. In this climate of change and greater sexual freedom in the cinema, the character of the Hero also inevitably changed. In the forefront of this attack was James Bond, Ian Fleming‘s sexual athlete, who was first brought to the screen in Doctor No (1962). So successful was the Bond franchise that the screen became deluged with carbon copies of Fleming’s hero. James Bond is the anti-Sherlock, a gadget-toting girl-seducing sophisticated secret agent who only seems to show any ingenuity when in a brawl or in a bed. Suffice to say that in a world of beds, breasts and bad language, Holmes has no place so, since the start of this permissiveness, the straightforward Sherlock Holmes movie has become a rare animal indeed.
The idea behind A Study In Terror (1965) was certainly inspired – pitting the world’s greatest detective against the world’s most fiendish serial killer, Jack The Ripper. It seems strange that no-one had ever considered bringing about this confrontation before – while the Ripper was committing atrocities upon unfortunate prostitutes in 1888, Holmes was working on the Baskerville case. It was also the very first X-rated Holmes movie, awarded not for any horror content as such, but for the sexual elements implicit in the plot. The film opens during Jack The Ripper’s reign of terror in London’s East End, where two street women have already met gruesome deaths, and a third is to die before the great detective becomes involved with the murders, and he does so in an unusual way. Holmes (John Neville) receives an anonymous package with a Whitechapel postmark, containing a case of surgical instruments with the postmortem scalpel missing. As Holmes scrutinises the case, Watson (Donald Houston) asks if it tells him anything:
“To start with the obvious, these instruments belong to a medical man who has descended to hard times. The instruments of one’s trade are always the last things to be pawned. Observe this speck of white – silver polish. No surgeon would ever clean his instruments with silver polish. They’ve been treated like common cutlery by someone concerned only with their appearance. This is substantiated by these chalk marks, they relate to the pawn ticket number. If the pawnbroker had thought they were stolen he would never have displayed them in a window. The shop faces south in a narrow street and business is bad. I should also add that the pawnbroker is a foreigner. Observe how the material has faded here – the sun has touched the inside of the case only when at its height and able to shine over the roofs of the buildings opposite, hence the shop is in a narrow street facing south, and business had to be bad for the case to remain undisturbed for so long.” Watson asks how he can be so sure the pawnbroker is a foreigner. “The seven in the pledge number is crossed in the Continental manner.”
It would seem from this elaborate piece of deduction that Holmes is in fine form and the screenwriters have captured the true flavour of Arthur Conan Doyle. Unfortunately this standard is not easily maintained and the rest of the film fails to match this fine exposition. Holmes finds the Osborne coat-of-arms under the felt lining of the box and decides to pay a visit to the head of this noble family (Barry Jones), who recognises the box of instruments as belonging to his eldest son Michael whom he has disowned. As they leave they bump into the Duke’s younger son, Lord Carfax (John Fraser), who confirms that the instruments belong to his brother who disappeared soon after graduating. Holmes’ next move is to seek out the Whitechapel pawnshop which is found, as predicted, in a narro",Jack The Ripper; Whitechapel Murderer; Annie Millwood; Jack the ripper; Fairy Fay; Leather Apron; Jack The Ripper; Ripperology; Jack the Ripper non-fiction; Ripperologists; Leatherapron; Jack the Ripper; Jack-the-Ripper; Whitechapel murderer; The Whitechapel murderer; Ripperologist; Annie Farmer; Leather apron; The Pinchin Street Murder; Ada Wilson; Jack the rippers victims; The Whitechapel Murderer,Jack The Ripper,Jack The Ripper.,1,1

Here's the puzzle for the week:  For each of the following European countries or areas (basically those that now have a population of 4 million or more) — Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, England, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Moldova, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine — name at least one really famous (in America) and important scientist or inventor who was born there (that is, within its modern boundaries), who worked most of his life there, or who is culturally identified with the nation (even if he lived in a colony or a place that is no longer in the country).  Also, include people for any of the smaller countries, if you can think of them.  It's surprisingly hard for some countries, even some big and formerly prominent ones, notably Spain.
I have my current list hidden below.  If you have some names for the countries that are not yet filled in, please e-mail them to me at volokh at law.ucla.edu.  Please include a URL of a page that confirms the person's affiliation with the country.  Please do not send me more names for countries for which people are already included (unless the included people are all somewhat iffy, generally because they may equally be claimed by another country).  Please also do not send me messages arguing that Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Uzbekistan, or Wales should be included.
The test of a famous person:  I must have heard of him.  Here I represent the typical American layperson who is not a scientist, but who likes science enough that he pays attention to relatively prominent scientists.  (It helps, fairly or not, if the person has something named after him.)  Special proviso for people now living or recently dead:  There must be good reason to think they'll be famous a century from now.
The test of an important scientist or inventor:  Entirely subjective, though if a scientist or inventor is still famous a century or more after his death, that's a good sign that he's important.  Note, though:  For inventors the invention has to be something pretty novel; for instance, much as I like my Glock, Gaston Glock doesn't count, even though his name is famous.  Likewise for Porsche, or the Belarus-born Sukhoi, whose name is famous among military aircraft buffs (a line of Soviet warplanes are named after him).  As I said, lots of arbitrariness here.

qz_1221,What is the name given to the largest bee in a hive?,"History of Bees | Galway Beekeepers
Videos
The western honey bee or European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is a species of honey bee. The genus Apis is Latin for “bee”, andmellifera comes from Latin melli- “honey” and ferre “to bear”—hence the scientific name means “honey-bearing bee”. The name was coined in 1758 by Carolus Linnaeus who, upon realizing the bees do not bear honey, but nectar, tried later to correct it to Apis mellifica(“honey-making bee”) in a subsequent publication. However, according to the rules of synonymy in zoological nomenclature, the older name has precedence. As of October 28, 2006, the Honey Bee Genome Sequencing Consortium fully sequenced and analyzed the genome of Apis mellifera.
In 2007, media attention focused on colony collapse disorder, a decline in European honey bee colonies in a minority of regions of North America.
Geographic distribution
The western honey bee is native to the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. As of the early 1600s, the insect was introduced to North America, with subsequent introductions of other European subspecies two centuries later. Since then, they have spread throughout the Americas.
Western honey bees differentiated into geographic races as they spread from Africa into Eurasia. Currently, 28 subspecies based on these geographic variations are recognized. All races are cross-fertile, though reproductive adaptations may make crossing unlikely. The 28 subspecies can be assigned to one of four major branches based on work by Ruttner, and subsequently confirmed by analysis of mitochondrial DNA. African subspecies are assigned to branch A, northwest European subspecies to branch M, southwest European subspecies to branch C, and Mideast subspecies to branch O. The subspecies are grouped and listed in the sidebar. Regions with localized variations may become identified subspecies in the near future, such as A. m. pomonella from the Tian Shan Mountains, which would be included in the Mideast subspecies branch.
Geographic isolation led to numerous adaptations as honey bees spread after the last ice age. These adaptations include brood cycles synchronized with the bloom period of local flora, forming a winter cluster in colder climates, migratory swarming in Africa, enhanced foraging behavior in desert areas, and numerous other inherited traits.
 
 
Stages of development of the drone pupae
In the temperate zone, honey bees survive winter as a colony, and the queen begins egglaying in mid to late winter, to prepare for spring. This is most likely triggered by longer day length. She is the only fertile female, and deposits all the eggs from which the other bees are produced. Except for a brief mating period when she may make several flights to mate with drones, or if she leaves in later life with a swarm to establish a new colony, the queen rarely leaves the hive after the larvae have become full-grown bees. The queen deposits each egg in a cell prepared by the worker bees. The egg hatches into a small larva which is fed by ‘nurse’ bees (worker bees which maintain the interior of the colony). After about a week, the larva is sealed up in its cell by the nurse bees and begins the pupal stage. After another week, it will emerge an adult bee.
For the first 10 days of their lives, the female worker bees clean the hive and feed the larvae. After this, they begin building comb cells. On days 16 through 20, a worker receives nectar and pollen from older workers and stores it. After the 20th day, a worker leaves the hive and spends the remainder of its life as a forager. The population of a healthy hive in mid-summer can average between 40,000 and 80,000 bees.
The larvae and pupae in a frame of honeycomb are referred to as frames of brood and are often sold (with adhering bees) by beekeepers to other beekeepers to start new beehives.
Both workers and queens are fed “royal jelly” during the first three days of the larval stage. Then workers are switched to a diet of pollen and nectar or diluted honey, while those intended for queens will continue to receive royal jelly. This causes the larva to develop to the pupa stage more quickly, while being also larger and fully developed sexually. Queen breeders consider good nutrition during the larval stage to be of critical importance to the quality of the queens raised, with good genetics and sufficient number of matings also being factors. During the larval and pupal stages, various parasites can attack the pupa/larva and destroy or damage it.
Queens are not raised in the typical horizontal brood cells of the honeycomb. The typical queen cell is specially constructed to be much larger, and has a vertical orientation. However, should the workers sense the old queen is weakening, they will produce emergency cells known as supersedure cells. These cells are made from a cell with an egg or very young larva. These cells protrude from the comb. As the queen finishes her larval feeding, and pupates, she moves into a head downwar",Queen; Quene; Queene; Queen; Queen (disambiguation); Queen (automobile); Queen (album); Queen (song),There is no specific information in the context that describes the largest bee in a hive.,The question is not directly answered in the provided context.,0,0

At six feet tall, Australia's red kangaroo is the planet's largest marsupial.
Tom Brakefield/Stockbyte/Getty Images
Marsupials are mammals that give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mother's body. Once inside, the infant, sometimes called a joey, feeds and continues to grow by attaching itself to a nipple. While most marsupials are native to Australia and the surrounding islands, some are found in the Americas.
Kangaroos and Wallabies
Australia, Tasmania and New Guinea are home to more than 50 species of kangaroos and wallabies, known as macropods, due to the large feet of these marsupials. The largest, the red kangaroo of Australia's inland plains, can be up to six feet tall; gray kangaroos are smaller and found in woodlands. Wallabies, medium-sized marsupials, live in a variety of habitats, including shrubs, swamps and rocky cliffs. Ground-dwelling kangaroos and wallabies get around by hopping. There are also 14 species of arboreal kangaroos, two of which, the Bennett and Lumholtz varieties, occur in Australia. Kangaroos and wallabies are herbivores that eat a variety of grasses and other vegetation.
Koalas
The gray-furred, tree-dwellers commonly referred to as koala bears are also marsupials. A koala's pouch faces backward, an adaptation that enabled its burrower ancestors to dig tunnels without getting dirt in their pouches. Found in eastern and southeastern Australia, koalas live in eucalyptus trees, the leaves of which comprise their entire diet. Koalas grow to be two to three feet long and weigh between nine and 29 pounds.
Wombats
The wombat, which the National Geographic website describes as ""pudgy,"" is a burrower marsupial with brown or gray fur. Like a koala, a wombat's pouch faces the legs to keep dirt out as the animal digs. Wombats are herbivores that feed on grasses, roots, tubers and even tree bark. There are three species: the common wombat, northern hairy-nosed wombat and southern hairy-nosed wombat. Hairy-nosed wombats have larger ears and softer fur than common wombats.
Tasmanian Devils
Named by European settlers for the fierce temper they display when threatened or fighting for food, today the nocturnal Tasmanian devil occurs only on the island of Tasmania. It has black or dark brown fur, grows up to 30 inches in length and can weigh up to 26 pounds. Females give birth to 20 to 30 young at a time, but only have enough nipples inside their pouches to nourish four. Tasmanian devils, the largest carnivorous marsupial, consume fish, insects, snakes, birds and carrion.
Possums
Possums, which are tree-dwellers, are the most widespread marsupial. Like Tasmanian devils, possums give birth to as many as 20 offspring, but only a few survive. There are 13 species of possums in Australia. North America is home to one species, the Virginia opossum, known to ""play dead"" when threatened by a predator. The yapok, or water opossum, one of multiple possum species in South America, is carnivorous and an able swimmer.
Gliders
Australia has six species of gliders -- relatives of the possum that have a membrane between the front and rear limbs that allow them to momentarily float through the air. Among them is the tiny feathertail glider, which gets its name from its feather-like, prehensile tail, and the better known sugar glider. Gliders are active at night and live in trees in Australia's woodlands and forests. They subsist on nectar, pollen, sap, leaves and insects.",Joey; Joey (disambiguation); Joey (song); Joey (film); Joey,Joey,joey,1,1

The Broons and Oor Wullie, Scotland's favourite comic stars, first appeared in the newly created Fun Section in The Sunday Post on March 8th, 1936. The Broons brought a wry slice of family life with a close-knit clan, all of whom, from the wise-beyond-her-years Bairn to eternally young-at-heart Granpaw, were instantly recognisable as the kind of people you might meet in any street in any Scottish city. While Oor Wullie was a young rascal who would become a hero to children and brought back warm childhood memories for adults with his cheeky sense of fun and lively adventures in his own wee town. Both stories were an instant hit!

Why Einstein never received a Nobel prize for relativity
Nobel prizes often attract controversy, but usually after they have been awarded. Albert Einstein's physics prize was the subject of argument for years before it was even a reality

There was a lot riding on Einstein winning a Nobel prize. Beyond his academic reputation, and that of the Nobel Institute for recognising greatness, the wellbeing of his former wife and their two sons depended upon it.
In the aftermath of the first world war, defeated Germany was being consumed by hyper-inflation. The government was printing more money to pay the war reparations and, as a result, the mark went into freefall against foreign currencies. Living in Berlin, Einstein was naturally affected by the crisis.
He had divorced Mileva in 1919, several years after she had returned to Switzerland with the boys, Hans-Albert and Eduard. As part of the settlement, Einstein pledged any eventual Nobel prize money to her for their upkeep. As the hyper-inflation bit ever deeper, so he needed that cash.
By this time, Einstein had a decade's worth of Nobel nominations behind him. Yet each year, to mounting criticism, the committee decided against his work on the grounds that relativity was unproven. In 1919, that changed. Cambridge astrophysicist Arthur Eddington famously used a total eclipse to measure the deflection of stars' positions near the Sun. The size of the deflection was exactly as Einstein had predicted from relativity in 1915. The prize should have been his, but the committee snubbed him again.
Why? Because now dark forces were at work.
Antisemitism was on the rise in Germany; Jews were being scapegoated for the country's defeat in the war. As both Jew and pacifist, Einstein was an obvious target. The complexity of relativity did not help either. Opponents such as Ernst Gehrcke and Philipp Lenard found it easy to cast doubt upon its labyrinthine mathematics.
The situation reached crisis point in 1921 when, paralysed by indecision, the Nobel Committee decided it was better not to award a prize at all than to give it to relativity. The arguments raged for another year until a compromise was reached.
At the suggestion of Carl Wilhelm Oseen, Einstein would receive the deferred 1921 prize, but not for relativity. He would be given it for his explanation of the photoelectric effect , a phenomenon in which electrons are emitted from a metal sheet only under certain illuminations. The work had been published back in 1905.
It has been argued that this work, which introduced the concept of photons , has had more impact than relativity. I'm not sure. With relativity, Einstein gave us a way to understand the Universe as a whole. It was a staggering leap forward in our intellectual capability.
The Nobel citation reads that Einstein is honoured for ""services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". At first glance, the reference to theoretical physics could have been a back door through which the committee acknowledged relativity. However, there was a caveat stating that the award was presented ""without taking into account the value that will be accorded your relativity and gravitation theories after these are confirmed in the future"".
To many, and to Einstein himself, this felt like a slap in the face. Hadn't Eddington proved the theory? Yes, but the trouble was Eddington's observations had not been perfect and he had discarded data he considered poor from his final analysis. To some, as related in Jeffrey Crelinsten's Einstein's Jury , this smacked of cooking the books in Einstein's favour. In reality it was just good scientific practice.
There is also another way to read the Nobel caveat. Could it have been that the committee was leaving the door open for a second Nobel prize in the future, once relativity had been more rigorously tested? We will never know. As Einstein's fame spread, so he alienated himself from the physics community by refusing to accept quantum theory. A Nobel prize for relativity was never awarded.
The final twist in this story is that Einstein did not attend his prize giving. Despite being informed that he was about to receive the prize, he chose to continue with a lecture tour of Japan. Partly, this was because he no longer valued the prize and partly it was because he needed to disappear.
German foreign minister Walther Rathenau had been murdered by anti-Semites. In the subsequent investigation, the police had found Einstein's name on a list of targets.

SEMANTIC ENIGMAS
What are the plastic bits at the end of shoelaces called?
THE WORD is ""aglet"". A chemist at Berkeley has recently made a molecular version for stopping the ends of certain long intertwined molecules from fraying.
Matthew Todd, University Chemical Laboratory, Cambridge.
THIS is a classic example of the family of names for things you didn't know had a name (and probably didn't care). Others are the indent at the bottom of a wine bottle (a kick or a punt) and the wire contraption on table lamps that keeps the shade off the bulb (a harp). Learn these and impress your friends!
Rob Shipway, London E17.
THE SECONDARY purpose of an aglet is when purchasing a dictionary: if it doesn't include the word, then don't buy it. Another good word for this test is ferrule, the tip on the bottom of an umbrella.
Robert Moye, London SE4.
While 'aglet' may be a correct term for the plastic bits on the ends of shoelaces, spare a thought for Dr. Wolfgang FlÃ¼gle, of the University of Heidleberg in Germany. It was he who originally discovered that small piece of sheep's intestine, suitably cleaned and shrunk, was a perfect device to prevent his own laces from unravelling. This idea caught on, and the device became known as FlÃ¼glebinder (plural) (lit. 'FlÃ¼gle's ties') but the unfortunate academic failed to patent the idea, which was later pinched by the chap who name them 'aglets'.

Editor’s Note: Today’s caption is the answer to Earth Observatory’s February Puzzler.
The Danube River is the largest in the European Union, its watershed draining 801,463 square kilometers (309,447 square miles) of land across 19 countries. Where that great river reaches the Black Sea, a remarkable delta has formed—the “Everglades” of Europe. The Danube Delta is home to more than 300 species of bird and 45 species of freshwater fish.
The Danube Delta has been home to human settlements since the end of the Stone Age (the Neolithic Period), and the ancient Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines all built trading ports and military outposts along this coast. Today, the border between Romania and Ukraine cuts through the northern part of the delta. The area is a United Nations World Heritage Site, both for its natural and human history, and for the traditional maritime culture that persists in its marshes. All the while, the landscape has been shaped and re-shaped by nature and man.
The image above was acquired on February 5, 2013, by the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA’s Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite. The Danube Delta has a number of lobes formed over the past several thousand years, and this image is focused largely on the northernmost Chilia (or Kilia) lobe. It is the youngest section of the delta—somewhere between 300 to 400 years old—and lies mostly within Ukraine. Much of the land in the image above is officially considered part of the Danube Biosphere Reserve. (To see more about how the delta formed, click here. )
Near the center of the image, the small city of Vylkove is known as the “Ukranian Venice,” due to its canals. To the lower left, the older Sulina lobe of the delta stretches to the south and further inland into Romania. White and brown curved lines reveal beach ridges and former shorelines, with the whiter ridges composed almost entirely of pure quartz sand in high dunes. To the east of the ridges, most of the landscape is flat marshland that is mostly brown in the barren days of winter.
The Bystroye Canal through the center of the Chilia lobe has been the subject of heated debate over the past two decades. Over the centuries, damming and channeling of the Danube throughout Europe has reduced its water flow and sediment load to roughly 30 percent of what it once was, according to coastal geologist Liviu Giosan of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In recent years, the Ukrainian government has dredged some delta channels (including Bystroye) and proposed extensive dredging of others in order to provide navigational channels for large ships. Proponents argue for the economic needs of water transportation routes. Opponents note that deeper, faster channels mean less mud and sand is deposited in the delta; in some places, more is carried away by swifter currents. Both affect the sensitive ecosystems and the ability of the delta to restore itself and grow.
In a 2012 report led by Giosan, scientists noted that the shape, water chemistry, and biology of Danube Delta was being altered long before the modern Industrial Era. Land use practices—particularly farming and forest clearing—added significant amounts of nutrients into the water and reduced salinity in the Black Sea, changing the dominant species of phytoplankton and sending a ripple of effects through the entire food web.

Marillion are a British rock band, formed in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, England, in 1979. Their recorded studio output since 1982 is composed of seventeen albums generally regarded in two distinct eras, delineated by the departure of original frontman Fish in late 1988, and the subsequent arrival of replacement Steve Hogarth in early 1989.
The song featured in the Movie Clip : ""Sugar Mice"" dates back to the ""Fish Era"" and features a stunning guitar solo from Steve Rothery.

qz_2428,What are the shape-shifting foxes of the Japanese folklore?,"Introduction to Shapeshifting
   
An Introduction to Shapeshifting
Metamorphosis is a strong impetus for growth, it aids us in changing ourselves, our perceptions of the world and our relationship with the world. When we consciously employ positive change in our lives, we can destroy that which no longer serves us, and embrace that which will help us transform in a positive way.
When working with animal spirits and energies, it is possible to consciously employ metamorphosis in the form of shapeshifting. I am not talking about literally or physically changing your form in the way of many movies and fantasy stories, instead I am talking about the act of embracing, emulating or taking into yourself the qualities of an animal in order to experience change and metamorphosis.
Shapeshifting can be magically understood as being the ability to change and shift the thoughts and perceptions we usually inhabit. As a human we have ways that we perceive the world around us, but with bat inside our body and mind, the way we perceive the world and ourselves changes radically. Through the processes of inviting the animal energy to become a part of us, we shift and change our own understanding.
The act of shape-shifting has been common throughout many shamanic, neoshamanic and pagan cultures for a very long time. In many shamanic tales, such as The Roe Deer Man (Nauwald, 2004, p. 94), a person could change quite easily between an animal and a human using techniques that involves wearing an animal's skin or an animal part, or simply using thought and will to change the form. In Japanese mythology, the kitsune or fox spirits were thought to be able to take the form of humans, or alternatively possess humans so that they became more fox-like in nature. In paganism, many gods and goddesses possess the ability to change form, and even those who spend a great deal of time as an animal - such as the Morrighu (who occupies the form of ravens in some depictions), or even the Horned God, Cernunnos, who can appear as a stag, or an antlered man (as seen on the fresco of the Pilier des nautes in Paris).
Those gods, spirits and entities who could change into animals often took on the nature of those animals. Those who were possessed by foxes in Japan were thought to take on 'fox-like' qualities, their eyes became more calculating and cunning, they were said to yelp like a fox yelps, they became at times deceptive, and women who were possessed were thought to be more deliberately seductive and graceful (Hearn, 2005 / Nozaki, 1961). For those who believe in lycanthropy or werewolves, it was thought that lycanthropes took on the qualities of wolves, from craving raw meat, to becoming more alert and comfortable in nature and sometimes even taking on the physical appearance of a wolf (Hamel, 1969).
When working magic or ritual, shapeshifting with animal energies involves the invocation of that animal energy into the self. It is not a responsibility to be taken lightly, and one should not attempt it unless they have a comprehensive understanding of grounding techniques. Depending on the animal and the person involved, it can be difficult to fully rid the self of the animal energy, and this can be a problem if the animal energy is quite different to your usual personality and/or you are finding that it is becoming destructive or unhelpful.
Why Shapeshift:
1. Knowledge and Expansion - seeing the world through human eyes is wonderful most of the time, but sometimes it helps to literally see the world through a different perspective. Working consciously with animal energies is a way of getting that perspective. Seeing the world through the eyes of spirit wolf, or spirit snail even, can help us to understand the differences and diversity in this world, while also helping us to feel even more interconnected with nature. When taking in the energy of other animals, we expand our own perceptions and knowledge.
2. Reconciliation - shapeshifting can be especially helpful to help us reconcile our differences with animals we do not like or fear. For example, I can invite chimpanzee spirit into my body (an animal I am not a big fan of!) and watch how it changes my personality and actually experience what I don't like about it. I can literally observe from the inside out and see what in particular about the animal energy is setting off my inner alarms and making me feel resentful or uneasy. Working directly with animal energies we have problems with in this manner can also help us to see what we have in common with that animal, and help us to see what we do not like about ourselves.
3. Communion - engaging with the animal world and with animal spirits through shapeshifting enables us to experience a profound sense of communion; not just with the animal that we invite into ourselves, but also with all of nature. Shapeshifting in this way can be a way of reconnecting with nature and the great spirit/s, and also a way of experiencing 'life.'

Playing with your emotions until the very end, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is the type of film that will have you thinking a certain way about something until it is completey turned around into something different. Beginning as a comedy about a DJ who has come to Vietnam to run a radio station in hopes to lighten the mood of Troops in the war and to give a quirky version of the serious news to people around the country. Although it is the reason he is brought in, it may also be the reason they want him to leave. One thing leads to another and the film does a total 180, turning into an all out drama where Robin Williams gives one of his best performances ever. Extremely well-written, well-directed, and superbly acted by everyone, ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" is easily one of the best films I've ever seen Robin Williams in.

'Goooooooood morning Vietnam! It's 0600 hours. What does the ""O"" stand for? O my God, it's early!'   Ah back in the day there was a steady stream of Nam war flicks that would produce great performances, great visuals, heavy emotion and eloquent musical scores, this film isn't exactly one of those films. But like all Nam films this too is actually based on true events, the true life events of one Adrian Cronauer, not exactly of course.  The films story isn't actually all that original really, it reads more like something of a tacky kids flick, an underdog story or 'Sgt Bilko'. Robin Williams play Cronauer, an Airman and DJ brought over to Saigon (65) to work for the US armed forces on their radio station. Of course up to this point the radio service has been stuffy, dull and pretty uninspiring, but not for long. Cronauer explodes on the air with his own brand of crazy, wacky in your face humour that very quickly upsets his superiors. From here on the film merely shows the battles between Cronauer and his officers and the depths they go to to try get him off the air for good.  If ever a film were a vehicle for someone this is it, Williams burst onto the air in the story and burst onto the scene in Hollywood with his performance. Despite the fact that I don't really enjoy watching Williams that much or his style of comedy, you can't deny the tour de force on show here. His continuous verbal assaults make you weary, its amazing how he can go on and on never seeming to run dry. In all honesty much of the humour within the film isn't all that funny really, for me it just gives you an idea of what the characters aim was, some of the dialog and jokes are pretty dated now too. There are some bits of dialog that make you laugh, some that are impressive simply because of the speed Williams relays them, but overall I got tired of listening to him.  'Talkin' out in the field. Hi, what's your name?' 'My name's Bob Fliber!' 'Bob, what do you do?' 'I'm in artillery!' 'Thank you, Bob. Can we play anything for you?' 'Anything! Just play it loud, OK?!'  As said the plot is very basic but delivers obvious good morals from Williams character, his companions and the whole idea of trying to provide the truth instead of deception. I'm unsure how much of this film is genuinely truthful as Cronauer is most definitely the perfect superhero. He falls for a local woman, befriends the locals and stands up for the locals against bigotry from US troops, pretty much an all round freedom fighter of justice. Nothing wrong with that of course but it does seem a bit over fabricated, did all this really happen? was Cronauer really involved that much? did he really go against his superiors to the point of disobeying rather important protocols?. A bit of movie magic artistic license methinks.  To be honest I found Bruno Kirby's performance as Second Lieutenant 'Steven Hauk' just as good if not better than Williams. This is a guy who believes he is funny and naturally is not...of course. His idea of humour is dated within the film, a kind of old panto/stand up style, but the cringing way he attempts his particular brand of comedy is hilarious and extremely awkward to watch it really is. His character is the typical bickering, snivelling, slimy jobsworth that runs to his superior for backup and assistance when the grunts ignore him showing no respect for rank, classic stuff.

qz_2466,Who stars in the 2008 movie Seven Pounds?,"Seven Pounds Movie Review & Film Summary (2008) | Roger Ebert
Tweet
I am fascinated by films that observe a character who is behaving precisely, with no apparent motivation. A good actor brings such a role into focus, as Will Smith does in the enigmatically titled ""Seven Pounds."" Who is he, what does he want, why is he behaving so oddly for an IRS agent? And why won't he kiss Rosario Dawson , when they both so obviously want that to happen?
Advertisement
As Ben Thomas, the man from the IRS, he can get in anywhere and ask any question. But surely the IRS doesn't require him to punch a nursing home supervisor for not allowing an old lady her bath? And why, after he intuits he is speaking to a blind man on the phone, is he so needlessly cruel to him? And why then does he follow the same man ( Woody Harrelson ) into a restaurant and engage him in conversation?
And why does he check into a fleabag hotel? Doesn't the IRS pay him a salary? And what favor does his lifelong friend Dan ( Barry Pepper ) owe him? And why is he looking for people who need their own favors? And so on. For much of the first hour of ""Seven Pounds,"" Ben Thomas acts according to a plan that seems perfectly clear, but only to himself. The reason it goes unexplained is that he has no need to explain it to himself, and no way to explain it to anyone else.
I am reminded of a film you should see some day, Melville's "" Le Samourai ,"" about a man who lies on a bed in a dark hotel room and smokes, and gets up, and pays meticulous attention to his appearance, and goes out into the night, and we have no idea who this man is. I find this more interesting than a movie about a man whose nature and objectives are made clear in the first five minutes, in a plot that simply points him straight ahead.

Will Smith displays a rather impressive range of emotional speeds here. He can be a tough, merciless IRS man. He can bend the rules on some cases. He can have a candlelight dinner with a beautiful woman named Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) and go home afterward. She can sense his deep sadness. He is angry with people sometimes, but he seems angriest of all at himself. It's quite a performance.
And Dawson makes Emily not simply a woman confused, maybe offended, by his behavior, but a woman of instinctive empathy, who does an emotional dance with him, following his lead when he needs to be treated like an IRS agent or like a perfect gentleman or like a man who needs understanding even if she doesn't know what she's supposed to understand.
I haven't even hinted about the hidden motives in this film. Miraculously for once, even the trailers don't give anything away. I'll tell you one thing: I may have made Ben sound like an angel, but he is very much flesh and blood, and none of his actions are supernatural. He has his reasons. The director is Gabriele Muccino , who also directed Smith in ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" He is effective at timing the film's revelations so that they don't come suddenly like a U-turn; they're revealed at the last necessary points in the story. Some people will find it emotionally manipulative. Some people like to be emotionally manipulated. I do, when it's done well.

Jackson, Andrew,
1767–1845, 7th President of the United States (1829–37), b. Waxhaw settlement on the border of South Carolina and North Carolina (both states claim him).
Early Career
A child of the backwoods, he was left an orphan at 14. His long military career began in 1781, when he fought against the British in a skirmish at Hanging Rock. He and his brother were captured and imprisoned at Camden, S.C. After studying law at Salisbury, N.C., he was admitted to the bar in 1787 and practiced in the vicinity until he was appointed solicitor for the western district of North Carolina (now Tennessee).
In 1788 he moved west to Nashville. He was prosperous in his law practice and in land speculation until the Panic of 1795 struck, leaving him with little more than his estate, the Hermitage. There, he built (1819–31) a home, on which he lived as a cotton planter during the intervals of his political career. The house, a handsome example of a Tennessee planter's home, with a fine formal garden, was constructed of bricks made on the estate. Jackson married Rachel Donelson before she had secured a legal divorce from her first husband, and though the ceremony was later repeated, his enemies made capital of the circumstance.
He rose in politics, was a member of the convention that drafted the Tennessee Constitution, and was elected (1796) as the sole member from the new state in the U.S. House of Representatives. The next year when his political chief, William Blount, was expelled from the Senate, Jackson resigned and, to vindicate his party, ran for the vacant seat. He won, but in 1798 he resigned. From 1798 to 1804 he served notably as judge of the Tennessee superior court.

Queen Mother pleaded for Charles not to be schooled in Scotland
Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother warned against sending the Prince of Wales    to boarding school in Scotland because she thought he would be miserable,    according to a collection of her previously unpublished letters.

Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother wanted Prince Charles to attend Eton, not Gordonstoun Photo: IAN JONES
 
Follow
She petitioned the Queen not to send Prince Charles to Gordonstoun in Moray as he would feel “terribly cut off and lonely in the far north” and suggested that he instead attend the “staunchly protestant” Eton.
Despite the Queen Mother’s pleas, the Duke of Edinburgh ruled that his eldest son would attend his alma mater, located in rugged countryside near Elgin.
But her concerns proved accurate after the prince described the inter-denominational school as “Colditz in kilts”.
Dated May 23, 1961, the Queen Mother addressed her daughter as “My Darling Lillibet” before stating that she has been “thinking such as lot about Charles” and his schooling.
“I suppose he will be taking his entrance exam for Eton soon. I do hope he passes because it might be the ideal school for one of his character and temperament,” she wrote.

“However good Gordonstoun is, it is miles and miles away and he might be as well at school abroad.”
The Queen Mother, who was particularly fond of Charles, added: “All your friends’ sons are at Eton and it is so important to be able to grow up with people you will be with later in life.
“And so nice and so important when boys are growing up that you and Philip can see him during school days and keep in touch with what is happening. He would be terribly cut off and lonely in the far north.”
The grandmother, then aged 60, also questioned the inter-denominational ethos of Gordonstoun, which was founded by Kurt Hahn, an experimental German-Jewish educator.
She argued that admission to Eton “would solve many difficulties, one being religion”, before adding: “It’s always a tricky one with the heir to the throne and one would not be involved in any controversies in a staunchly Protestant place like Eton Chapel.”
The Queen Mother concluded by stating she hoped her eldest daughter did not mind her intervention but it was prompted by her concerns for Charles “all (probably without cause).”
The correspondence is included in Counting One’s Blessings, a recently published selection of the late Queen Mother’s letters compiled by William Shawcross, her official biographer.
Mr Shawcross said the Duke of Edinburgh won the debate after arguing Eton was too close to Windsor and London and Charles would be “harassed by the media” if he was schooled there.
He thought Charles would thrive at Gordonstoun because his eldest son loved Scotland, the author said.
But, unlike his father, the young prince did not enjoy the Spartan regime, which included cold showers, physical punishment and morning runs all year round.
In a letter home in 1963, he wrote: “The people in my dormitory are foul. Goodness, they are horrid. I don’t know how anybody could be so foul.”
One contemporary at the school recalled that Charles was bullied “maliciously, cruelly and without respite.”",Gordonston; Gordonstoun School; Gordonstun; Gordonstown; Gordonstoun; Gordonston; Gordonstounians; Gordonstone,Gordonstoun,Gordonstoun.,1,1

Updated August 31, 2016.
King Edward VIII did something that monarchs do not have the luxury of doing - he fell in love. King Edward was in love with Mrs. Wallis Simpson, not only an American, but also a married woman already once divorced. However, in order to marry the woman he loved, King Edward was willing to give up the British throne - and he did, on December 10, 1936.
To some, this was the love story of the century. To others, it was a scandal that threatened to weaken the monarchy. In reality, the story of King Edward VIII and Mrs. Wallis Simpson never fulfilled either of these notions; instead, the story is about a prince who wanted to be like everyone else.
Prince Edward Growing Up - His Struggle Between Royal and Common
King Edward VIII was born Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David on June 23, 1894 to the Duke and Duchess of York (the future King George V and Queen Mary ). His brother Albert was born a year and a half later, soon followed by a sister, Mary, in April 1897.

Test Your General Science Knowledge
Three more brothers followed: Harry in 1900, George in 1902, and John in 1905 (died at age 14 from epilepsy ).
Though his parents surely loved Edward, he thought of them as cold and distant. Edward's father was very strict which caused Edward to fear every call to his father's library, since it usually meant punishment.
In May 1907, Edward, only 12 years old, was shipped off to the Naval College at Osborne . He was at first teased because of his royal identity, but soon garnered acceptance because of his attempt to be treated like any other cadet.
After Osborne, Edward continued on to Dartmouth in May 1909. Though Dartmouth was also strict, Edward's stay there was less harsh.
During the night on May 6, 1910, King Edward VII, Edward's grandfather who had been outwardly loving to Edward, passed away. Thus, Edward's father became king and Edward became the heir to the throne.
In 1911, Edward became the twentieth Prince of Wales. Besides having to learn some Welsh phrases, Edward was to wear a particular costume for the ceremony.
[W]hen a tailor appeared to measure me for a fantastic costume . . . of white satin breeches and a mantle and surcoat of purple velvet edged with ermine, I decided things had gone too far. . . . [W]hat would my Navy friends say if they saw me in this preposterous rig?1
Though it is surely a natural feeling of teenagers to want to fit in, this feeling continued to grow in the prince. Prince Edward began to deplore being set on a pedestal or worshipped - anything that treated him as a ""person requiring homage.""2
As Prince Edward later wrote in his memoirs:
And if my association with the village boys at Sandringham and the cadets of the Naval Colleges had done anything for me, it was to make me desperately anxious to be treated exactly like any other boy of my age.3
World War I
In August 1914, when Europe became embroiled in World War I , Prince Edward asked for a commission. The request was granted and Edward was soon posted to the 1st Battalion of the Grenadier Guards. The prince. however, was soon to learn that he was not going to be sent to battle.
Prince Edward, extremely disappointed, went to argue his case with Lord Kitchener , the Secretary of State for War. In his argument, Prince Edward told Kitchener that he had four younger brothers who could become heir to the throne if he were killed in battle.
While the prince had given a good argument, Kitchener stated that it was not Edward being killed that prevented him from being sent into battle, but rather, the possibility of the enemy taking the prince as prisoner.4
Though posted far from any battle (he was given a position with Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force, Sir John French ), the prince did witness some of the horrors of the war. And while he wasn't fighting on the front, Prince Edward won the respect of the common soldier for wanting to be there.
Edward Likes Married Women
Prince Edward was a very good-looking man. He had blonde hair and blue eyes and a boyish look on his face that lasted his entire life. Yet, for some reason, Prince Edward preferred married women.
In 1918, Prince Edward met Mrs. Winifred (""Freda"") Dudley Ward . Despite the fact that they were about the same age (23), Freda had been married for five years when they met. For 16 years, Freda was Prince Edward's mistress.
Edward also had a long-time relationship with Viscountess Thelma Furness. On January 10, 1931, Lady Furness hosted a party at her country house, Burrough Court, where, in addition to Prince Edward, Mrs. Wallis Simpson and her husban","1936; one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-six; 1936",1936,1936,1,1

Bartle Road, the turning alongside the railway arches, was the site of the infamous ""10 Rillington Place"" where the serial killer ""Christie"" lived and carried out his atrocities in the late 1940's & early 50's.
This photo was taken from St. Mark's Road, W11.
Obviously, the old street with it's slum dwellings was demolished years ago, although it did have a name change to Ruston Close following the murder trial and the subsequent execution by hanging of the evil, Christie.

There's no graffiti in our village, and none in the closest town. So I have re-created the first bit of graffiti that I ever noticed - and it has stayed clearly in my mind over the intervening decades. As a student in Leeds I walked past this enigmatic message on the red brick terrace gable end every morning on my way to lectures, and back again at night. So I wanted to know about Timothy Evans, who he was and why I should remember him!
He was hanged in 1950 for the murder of his wife. In 1953 another man, John Christie, was rightly found guilty of the murder (and others). Ludovic Kennedy campaigned and wrote the book '10 Rillington Place' in 1955. Timothy Evans was exonerated, but no-one could give him his life back. The case became one of the main arguments in favour of abolishing the death penalty for murder. This was finally enacted in 1965.
Whoever wrote that particular piece of graffiti, I thank him/her! Without that constant message I would not be so aware of the events that lead up to our decision to live as a society that doesn't resort to the death penalty!

qz_3393,Which `B` was the name of the mechanical shark used in the original `Jaws` film?,"The Robot Shark Technology of Jaws - Tested
The Robot Shark Technology of Jaws
By David Konow
on June 26, 2013 at 2 p.m.
Giving the mechanical shark that terrified audiences in Jaws its proper due, despite the famous stories of its failures.
Tweet
The mechanical shark from Jaws has always gotten a bad rap. Anyone who has a passing interest in Jaws knows it kept breaking down, which was a blessing in disguise because Steven Spielberg had to add more character development and depth to the script.
At the same time, when we do see the shark, it’s damn scary, and if it wasn’t effective, even in the brief flashes it’s shown, Jaws wouldn’t be the masterpiece of terror we know and love today.

As Pat Jankiewicz, author of the Jaws compendium Just When You Thought It Was Safe , says, “The animatronic shark in Jaws showed how effective an animatronic special effect could be. While the stories of it malfunctioning are legendary, it is completely believable and terrifying onscreen. The climax, where the shark and Roy Schieder battle to the death, is utterly dependent on the creature's effectiveness and it delivers. While Steven Spielberg hid the shark until the climax, Bob Mattey's monster lives up to the film's build up by being as scary as we were told it would be up to that point.”
Jankiewicz adds, “It's amazing when you realize that Jaws was snubbed for an Oscar for the special effects, which went to the bland Hindenburg, as the shark led to the '80s and early '90s, which was a boomtown of animatronic creatures making millions for their studios, including Spielberg's own Jurassic Park, E.T. and Gremlins.”

The first person onboard to work on Jaws was art director Joe Alves, who also worked on Rod Serling’s Night Gallery, as well as Spielberg’s Sugarland Express and Close Encounters. When Jaws was first set up at Universal, the book was still in galleys, and the biggest names attached to it were producers David Brown and Richard Zanuck.
Alves drew up some sketches, and showed them to the FX department, who said, “We can’t do that. We can’t build that thing. It would take a year and a half, two years. Besides we’ve got bigger pictures like Earthquake and The Hindenburg.” In fact, Universal thought The Hindenburg was going to be its big movie for 1975. (Although it’s a long forgotten disappointment today, The Hindenburg is notable for the FX work of matte painting master Albert Whitlock.)
Marshall Green, who was head of production for Universal, got upset and told the FX department, “Jaws could be a bigger picture than The Hindenburg,” which was greeted with laughter. Green then met with Alves alone and asked, “Do you think we can get the shark made?” “Well I can certainly try,” Alves said. “Take it away from the studio,” Green replied. “Take it off this lot.”
Alves scouted locations for Jaws, and picked Martha’s Vineyard, but it wasn’t just a case of keeping the Universal brass from breathing down everyone’s necks. As Alves recalls, “In our naïve way, Steven and I, having seen The Old Man and the Sea, which was a good movie but it had terrible effects, said, ‘No, it’s gotta be a full-sized shark in the real ocean.’”
Jaws art director Joe Alves was determined to prove a top-notch mechanical shark could be done.
Of course this decision would come back to haunt Spielberg repeatedly throughout the shoot, but Alves was determined to prove a top-notch mechanical shark could be done. He kept going around to experts, who told him it would take several years, and the idea of putting it in the open water was anathema to them. Then Alves came in contact with Bob Mattey, the mechanical FX legend who created the giant squid from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, as well as Herbie from The Love Bug.
Mattey told Alves the shark could indeed be made, and he got to work. Then in January 1974, Jaws the novel was published and it was a big best-seller. Universal decreed the movie had to shoot that summer, which gave Mattey no time to perfect his mechanical monsterpiece.
Art director Joe Alves with Bruce under construction.
Actually, three sharks were built for Jaws at the cost of $150,000 each. They were collectively named Bruce, after Spielberg's lawyer. Roy Arbogast, who was honing his monster making skills as Mattey’s assistant, recalled that the sharks had a skin hard polyurethane rubber over a tubular-steel skeleton. As special effects supervisor Kevin Pike recalled in Just When You Thought It Was Safe, when painting the shark, “We used chopped-up walnuts, sand and dust in the paint to give the skin texture on the surface.”
When the sharks first arrived in Martha’s Vineyard, Pike asked if they had been tested in the water yet. The answer was no. Jaws was the first film Pike ever worked on, but he knew right there it was going to be a long shoot.
“When you got it in the salt water, it started to affect the electrolysis,” Alves says. “Everything that was electrical in the shark dissipated",Bruce; Bruce,Bruce,Bruce,1,1
qz_3431,Which Italian fashion designer was shot dead on the steps of his Miami mansion in 1997?,"Italian Fashion Designers - Our Top Six Selection
Italian Fashion Designers
When compiling a list of top Italian fashion designers, we stopped counting when we reached 60. Here are our picks for the most recognized names in the field today, in alphabetical order:
1. Armani
Legendary Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani was born on 11 July 1934 in Piacenza. His career began as an assistant designer for Nino Cerruti, but he left in 1970 to work as a freelancer. With a partner, Sergio Galeotti, he established the Armani label four years later.
In the 1980s Armani began designing for numerous Hollywood names, which catapulted him to international fame. In 2001, Forbes named him the most successful Italian fashion designer and estimated his net worth at $1.7 billion. Armani was the first designer to ban models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18. He has designed uniforms for various sporting events and has recently opened a restaurant in New York City.
2. Dolce & Gabbana
Domenico Dolce, born in 1958, near Palermo, Sicily, and Stefano Gabbana, born in 1962 in Milan, began as a couple, but separated in 2005. Unlike others in a similar situation, they were able to continue their business partnership and achieve outstanding success with their sleek and stylish clothing designs.
They have utilized their celebrity connections to great effect at their runway shows but have been dogged by legal wrangles, including a 2009 tax evasion charge. By 1997, their annual turnover was £400 million, and it topped £597 by 2005, making them one of the most financially successful Italian fashion designers.
3. Ferré
Born in Legnano on 15 August 1944, Gianfranco Ferré originally graduated as an architect in 1969 but began designing accessories a year later. He started his own company in 1974 and launched his first women's collection in 1978, followed by his first men's collection in 1982, and his first couture collection in 1986. Ferré became Stylistic Director of Christian Dior in Paris from 1989 to 1997.
Sophisticated white shirts have become the symbol of his personal signature in fashion design. His label offers several lines of men's wear, plus an underwear line, a sports line and a range of fragrances. His range of licensed products now includes shoes, stationery, luggage, home furnishings, perfumes and timepieces. Ferré won a number of prestigious awards during his career, including the L'Occhio d'Oro for Best Italian Fashion Designer six times. 70% of Ferré sales are achieved in export, with the US being the biggest market. Ferré distributes in exclusive boutiques worldwide.
Ferré died on June 17, 2007. On June 25 of 2008 the company entered into a worldwide joint venture with Dubai-based GIO Developments. The first project will be erected in Dubai. GIO Developments will oversee the real estate, construction, management and operations aspects of the projects, while Gianfranco Ferré will oversee content, design and style. 
4. Prada
Prada was founded by Mario Prada as a leather goods shop in Milan, Italy. After his death in the mid-1950s, Mario's daughter-in-law ran the company for almost twenty years, succeeded by her daughter, Miuccia Prada, in 1970.
Miuccia, born Maria Bianchi on 10 May 1949, had a Ph.D. in Political Science but with her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, set about expanding Prada's product line. In 1979 she released a set of backpacks and totes, followed by a nylon tote. A shoe line was released in 1984, the classic Prada handbag in 1985, and a women's wear collection in 1989. Prada's popularity skyrocketed and it became identified with affluent working women who held demanding jobs. Men's ready-to-wear collections were launched in the mid-1990s. Prada's originality made it one of the most influential Italian fashion designers, and the brand became a premium status symbol in the 1990s.
In 1983, Prada began expansion across continental Europe and the US and later Japan. The company went on an ultimately unsuccessful merger and purchasing spree which slowed in the 2000s. Prada manufactures its wares in Italy, apparently keeping labor costs down by using Chinese laborers at the plants. Prada, along with Calvin Klein and Gucci, is known for the practice of casting new models to walk exclusively in their runway shows. An exclusive or opening spot in a Prada show is among the most coveted bookings in the modeling world.
5. Valentino
Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani, best known as Valentino, was born on 11 May 1932 in Voghera, Lombardy. Valentino became interested in fashion while in primary school when he apprenticed under his aunt Rosa and local designer Ernestina Salvadeo. At 17, he moved to Paris and studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne. Later he apprenticed to Jacques Fath, followed by Balenciaga, Jean Desses and Guy Laroche. In 1959 he decided to return to Italy and set up in Rome.

qz_3920,What story introduced the Cybermen?,"A Brief History Of Time (Travel): Attack Of The Cybermen
Attack Of The  Cybermen
Plot
The TARDIS is commandeered by the mercenary Lytton and a group of Cybermen, who are using another captured time machine to travel back to 1985. There, the Cybermen intend to use Halley's Comet to obliterate the Earth, thus preventing the destruction of their home planet Mondas in  1986 and perverting the course of history. Taken prisoner on Telos, the  Doctor and Peri escape and ally themselves with the native Cryons. But  in order to stop the Cyber plot, they may have to rely on none other  than Lytton, whose motivations remain a mystery to all.
Production
The return of the Cybermen in 1982's Earthshock had been a popular success for Doctor Who. As a result, producer John Nathan-Turner and script  editor Eric Saward -- who had written Earthshock -- were eager to use the venerable  monsters to lead off the Sixth Doctor's first full season in 1985.  Saward, a fan of the Cybermen, was keen to tackle the serial himself.  Indeed, he hoped that this would be one of two adventures he would  contribute to Season Twenty-Two: he had missed out on the chance to  write a Doctor Who story the previous year because industrial  action had delayed his scripts for Resurrection Of  The Daleks from Season Twenty to Season Twenty-One.  Nathan-Turner, however, was keen to avoid the wrath of the Writers'  Guild, which would take a dim view of the Doctor Who script  editor commissioning himself for one-third of the year's output. He  informed Saward that he would only be permitted to write the season  finale, Revelation Of The Daleks .
Nonetheless, Saward turned to disc jockey and music producer Ian Levine,  a longtime Doctor Who fan who had been acting as a continuity  adviser to the production office. Levine had unsuccessfully proposed  several plot ideas in recent years, and Saward now suggested that they  collaborate on a storyline for the Cyberman tale. In late 1983, Levine  put together an outline entitled “Return To Telos&#8221. It was  agreed that this would draw heavily on the Cyberman stories of the  Sixties, most notably their 1966 debut adventure The Tenth Planet (in which their home planet,  Mondas, is destroyed in 1986) and 1967's The Tomb  Of The Cybermen (which established the existence of the Cyber  installation on Telos).
John Nathan-Turner knew that the press could not resist  hints that the TARDIS might lose its police box form
It appears that Saward then augmented Levine's outline with his own  creations, including the mercenary Lytton (first introduced in Resurrection Of The Daleks ) and the Cryons.  With the latter, Saward attempted to devise a realistic race of aliens  in which each member possessed a distinct personality, as opposed to the  monolithic throngs usually portrayed in science-fiction. The notion of  the Doctor attempting to repair the TARDIS chameleon circuit, meanwhile,  came from Nathan-Turner. He saw this as an excellent publicity vehicle,  since he knew that the press would not be able to resist hints that the  time machine might be losing its traditional police box form.
Given Nathan-Turner's edict, there was no question of Saward being  credited as the story's scriptwriter. Furthermore, Levine's working  relationship with the Doctor Who production office was maintained  with the understanding that he would not receive onscreen  acknowledgment. As a result, Saward turned to writer and teacher Paula  Woolsey, an ex-girlfriend with whom he was still on good terms. Woolsey  had also performed some research for Saward's first Doctor Who serial, The Visitation . Officially, Woolsey  would be the scriptwriter of the story resulting from Levine and  Saward's work, which was now called “The Cold War”.
The true extent of Woolsey's input into the scripts is unclear. Some  sources suggest that Saward wrote them in their entirety, and Woolsey's  only role was to serve as a figurehead to mislead Nathan-Turner. Other  sources indicate that Woolsey did write draft scripts, although these  were then considerably revised by Saward, at least in part because of  Woolsey's lack of experience in television. Saward himself has suggested  that even the storyline was largely Woolsey's creation, and he simply  worked with her to incorporate the Cybermen, the Cryons and Lytton;  Levine has denied this assertion, however.
Regardless, on January 10th, 1984, Woolsey was commissioned to script  part one of “The Cold War”. The second -- and final --  installment was then requested on February 21st. These were both  forty-five-minute episodes, in keeping with the plan agreed upon in the  spring of 1983 to modernise the Doctor Who format. Whereas Season  Twenty-One had consisted of twenty-six installments of twenty-five  minutes' duration, broadcast twice weekly, Season Twenty-Two would be  made up of thirteen weekly episodes, each three quarters of an hour  long. This would mark the first major format change for Doctor  Who since it p",The Tenth Planet; The Tenth Planet; Dr Who – Music from the Tenth Planet; Dr Who - Music from the Tenth Planet; The Tenth Planet (Doctor Who),Attack Of The Cybermen,Earthshock.,0,0

Simple Corrections to Stop Slicing The Ball
Golficity
Share on Twitter
We’ve all been there – the dreaded slice shot that starts off the tee going straight before violently slicing onto the next fairway or in someone’s backyard….
You replay the swing over and over in your mind and feel like you’ve done everything the same on tee but for some reason the ball slices sharply wreaking havoc on your score for the hole.
Let’s examine this issue a bit deeper by diving into a few quick tips to help you hit straighter shots both off the tee and on your mid-game (for simplicity we’ll be assuming you’re a right handed golfer, but if that’s not the case, just reverse the directions to the opposite side of the ball).
First let’s define what a slice shot is:
When you slice the ball, the flight path of the ball curves in the shape of a banana starting out to the left of the target before dramatically moving back to the right of the target.  The slice shot is one of the most common mishits for amateur golfers and it usually leads to penalty strokes and lost balls.
Now let’s break down basic slice avoidance in three parts:
Avoid Adjusting Your Aim
Golfers who slice the ball will often try to adjust their aim (aka alignment) and move their body left to change their aim.  The idea being if you’re going to slice the ball you might as well aim well to the left so that the ball will move back towards the intended target.
The problem with this “solution” is two-fold.  First, if you do manage to make solid contact and the ball doesn’t slice you’ll be well left of your target, and second, by simply “playing around your slice” you’ll never give yourself the opportunity to truly fix the problem.  This is not even mentioning the fact that a slice takes quite a bit of distance off the shot, so you’re selling yourself short every time you play into it.
Instead, try keeping your shoulders and body aimed at your target.  A simple way to check your aim and alignment is to hold the golf club horizontally across your thighs with the butt end of the handle pointing at your target, then move the club up across your shoulders to see if they too are aimed in the same direction.  You can also ask your playing partner to spot check you to see if you’re aimed at your target or if you’re too far left or right.
Truthfully, every golfer should own a cheap set of alignment sticks  (usually costing only around $20 or less on Amazon ) for use when practicing on the range, after all, they work, they’re inexpensive, and even the PGA TOUR pros use them!
Starting with these simple alignment techniques will make sure you’re squaring up properly to the ball and will help set the foundation for a proper swing.  Keep in mind that even something as simple as having your body misaligned can cause a slice, so make sure you’re pointing your shoulders and hips in the direction you want the ball to travel.
Changing Your Grip or Shaft
Proper grip pressure is key to a good swing.  A weaker grip will lead to a more open club face at impact and can therefore easily amplify a slice.  This doesn’t mean that you need to squeeze the life out of the club, because doing so will result in the opposite of a slice…known as a hook.
For righties, turning your grip slightly to the right will lead to a “stronger grip,” which will help prevent you from gripping the club more tightly.  The key with a golf grip is to avoid all tension in your wrists while eliminating the “weak grip” so that you’re not leaving the club face open at impact.
Bonus Tip: You may want to stop by a local golf shop if you are playing with a regular driver shaft and try hitting a stiffer shaft.  More flexible shafts allow the club to bend more during the swing which can lead to that push slice we’re trying to avoid.
Swing Impact
The point of impact is the most important thing to consider when correcting a slice.  For a golf ball to slice from left to right it must be spinning in a clockwise direction.
To understand better how this works try to visualize the process of striking a tennis ball with a racket.  In this example an open racquet that makes contact with the ball in a right to left motion will cause clockwise spin on the ball, making it curve from left to right.  That’s the exact same thing that his happening with a golf slice.
One easy way to tell if this is what is happening in your swing is to simply look at your divot (if you left one).  On the course (not so much on the tee box), the divot you create with your club (on a slice shot) will be pointing left, indicating that you are coming across the ball on impact.
If you’re noticing  a theme with these tips you’re right.  The key to correcting your slice is to make sure your fundamentals (aim, grip, and impact) are executed correctly.
So, if you’re trying to stop slicing the ball forget the gimmicks and don’t try to pile on a million little adjustments.  Instead focus on your going back t",Hook; Hook; HOOK,Hook,Hook.,1,1

Crunch time for Saracens and Northampton in Guinness Premiership play-offs
By Ian Stafford Updated: 18:05 EST, 15 May 2010
comments
Rugby is supposed to be the gentleman's game, but at Franklin's  Gardens this afternoon the gloves will be off when Northampton take on  Saracens for a place in the Guinness Premiership final.
After sharing four games already in the regular league season and the  LV Cup, the clubs are open about their mutual loathing.
It started with a transfer tug-of-war over the Northampton prop Soane  Tonga'uiha, who signed for Saracens for next season, then had a change  of heart, prompting various barbs from today's visitors.
Squaring up: Saracens Mouritz Botha and Northampton's Juandre Kruger take each other on
But what really stoked up the fires was the Premiership fixture at Franklin's two weeks ago, which Saracens sneaked 28-27 to end Northampton's unbeaten home run, before launching into their now traditional South Seas victory song in the away dressing room.
It prompted Northampton captain Dylan Hartley to launch a scathing attack on Sarries' 'over-celebration' and a volley from director of rugby Jim Mallinder, who criticised their rivals for a host of offences and has now accused Saracens of tapping up another Saints prop, Brian Mujati. Mallinder's counterpart, meanwhile, the colourful Brendan Venter, faces a RFU disciplinary hearing on Tuesday after he was accused of pushing a female Leicester supporter last Saturday at Welford Road.
This was during an amazing sequence of events which saw the former  Springbok harangued by the Tigers fans for blocking their view each time  he stood up in the stand.
His hooker, Schalk Brits, will also be at the hearing after showing the  Leicester crowd the finger.
Up for it: Northampton's Juande Kruger and Saracens' Alex Goode have a disagreement
This afternoon, something has to give and, judging by the noises being made by the players, Franklin's Gardens will not be a place for the faint-hearted.
'The song's going to be a little louder in the dressing room if we  win again,' said Saracens stand-off Glen Jackson.
'Brendan  has always encouraged us to enjoy the good moments in a season, and  that's all we do. We're not setting out to upset anyone but for some  reason we've copped a lot of flak over it, especially from the lovely  Dylan Hartley.
'They say we were lucky to win last time because Shane Geraghty missed a last-minute conversion, but we missed three golden opportunities to score a try and were deserved winners. But if Shane had kicked that conversion, I'm sure Northampton would have celebrated just like us.
'They've just tried to spice the match up. It's a case of sour grapes on their part. Northampton have just made the game more interesting now and there will be a great deal more feeling put into this one.'
Despite being the away team, Saracens, who followed up their win at Franklin's Gardens by taking Leicester's long-standing home record away from them, are brimming with confidence.
'It would have been nice to have played this semi at home, but we've just gone and won at Northampton and Leicester so a return trip to Northampton holds no fears for us,' added Jackson.
His opposite number, Stephen Myler, who continues to keep Geraghty out of the starting XV, said: 'We all heard the singing and, yes, we all took note of it because we knew we'd be meeting them again.
'We didn't play well on the day and they did. It's as simple as that. We know that if we can turn it on we'll beat any team. We have all the motivation in the world.'","Leicester.; County Borough of Leicester; Leicester, Leicestershire; Caerlyr; Leicester; Leicester UA; Leicester, United Kingdom; Leicester, England; Leicester, UK; Liecester; UN/LOCODE:GBLCS; Leicester.; Leycester; Caerlŷr; Leicesterians; City of Leicester",Leicester,Leicester.,1,1

Plans for 800 homes in Shottery refused
22 September 2011
Image caption A report said the development could have had an impact on Anne Hathaway's cottage
Plans to build up to 800 homes near Stratford-upon-Avon have been rejected by councillors.
Officers at Stratford-on-Avon District Council had recommended accepting the plans, which would have also included plans for a primary school, a health centre and shops in Shottery.
However, the planning committee refused them on Wednesday night on the grounds of the development's ""density"".
The developers said they were ""extremely disappointed"".
The chair of the planning committee, Sir William Lawrence, said the proposals for the land, south-west of Alcester Road, were rejected ""purely on the density"" of the housing development.
He added: ""Up to 800 houses round the back of Shottery is almost like a new town.""
Appealing decision
Sir William said the council agreed there was a need for new homes, but not to this extent in one area.
The report that went to the planning committee highlighted concerns the development could have on Anne Hathaway's cottage and its immediate surroundings.
A spokesman for developers Bloor Homes and Hallam Land Management said they would be appealing against the decision.
He added: ""We are extremely disappointed.
""We are also saddened that after two years of detailed discussions with the council about the proposals, which are essentially its own plans, that members have chosen to ignore the clear findings of the research that they themselves commissioned on future housing requirements.""",Anne Hathaway; The Hathaway effect; The hathaway effect; Anne Hathaway (actress); Anne Jacqueline Hathaway; Anne hathaway (actress); Adam Shulman; Anne Hathaway filmography; Annie Hathaway; Anne Hathaway (actor); Anne Hathaway; Anne hathaway; Hathaway effect,Anne Hathaway,Anne Hathaway.,1,1

Acadians
Acadians are the descendants of a group of French-speaking settlers who migrated from coastal France in the late sixteenth century to establish a French colony called Acadia in the maritime provinces of Canada and part of what is now the state of Maine. Forced out by the British in the mid-sixteenth century, a few settlers remained in Maine, but most resettled in southern Louisiana and are popularly known as Cajuns.
Afghan Americans
Modern-day Afghanistan, torn by both civil and foreign wars, repeats the cycle of oppression, invasion, and turmoil that has plagued it for centuries. As the twenty-first century was about to begin, Afghan people struggled in their own land and flooded the globe in increasing numbers to escape dangers from within their borders and from without.
African Americans
The continent of Africa, the second largest on the globe, is bisected by the equator and bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the east by the Indian Ocean. Roughly the shape of an inverted triangle—with a large bulge on its northwestern end and a small horn on its eastern tip—it contains 52 countries and six islands that, together, make up about 11.5 million square miles, or 20 percent of the world's land mass.
Albanian Americans
Albania is a mountainous country, 28,748 square miles in size, slightly larger than the state of Maryland. It is located in southeastern Europe and borders Montenegro, Serbia, and Macedonia on the north and east, Greece in the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea on the west.
Armenian Americans
The estimated 700,000 Americans of Armenian ancestry are descended from an ancient nation located at the borders of modern Russia, Turkey, and Iran. Through much of the past 4,000 years, Armenians have been a subjugated people with no independent state until September 23, 1991, when the Soviet Union dissolved and the 3,400,000 people in that area voted to form a new Republic of Armenia.
Asian Indian Americans
India, the most populous country in South Asia, is a peninsula. Bounded by Nepal and the Himalaya mountains to the north, Pakistan to the northwest, the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the west, and the Bay of Bengal to the east, India occupies about 1,560,000 square miles.
Australian and New Zealander Americans
Since immigration statistics usually combine information about New Zealand with that of Australia, and because similarities between the countries are great, they are linked in this essay also. The Commonwealth of Australia, the world's sixth largest nation, lies between the South Pacific and the Indian Ocean.
Austrian Americans
A mountainous landlocked country located in south-central Europe, Austria encompasses an area of 32,377 square miles, roughly the size of the state of Maine. Bordered to the west by Switzerland and Liechtenstein, to the south by Italy and the former Yugoslavia, to the east by Hungary, and to the north by the Czech and Slovak Republics as well as Germany, Austria lies at the center of political and geographic Europe.
Bangladeshi Americans
Bangladesh, which means the ""Land of the Bengalis"" in the Bengali language, is a republic located in Southeast Asia. Almost entirely surrounded by India, of which it was a part until 1947, Bangladesh is bounded to the east, north, and west by that larger country, and to the southeast by Myanmar, formerly Burma.
Belgian Americans
Belgium, whose official name is the Kingdom of Belgium, is a densely populated country not much larger than the state of Maryland. It covers an area of 11,781 square miles (30,519 square kilometers), bounded on the north by The Netherlands, on the west by France, and on the east by Germany.

ABOUT THIS ALBUM
Album Notes
MADE IN AMERICA - VAUDEVILLE SONGS is a tribute to the thousands who traveled the vaudeville circuit of America from the 1880s through the early 1930s.  In particular, one family by the Gumm, performed on the boards, the youngest of which became known as the world's greatest entertainer, Judy Garland.
THE STORY:
In 1895, Frank Gumm sang the popular songs of the day in Murfreesboro, TN (And the Band Played On).  Soon, he left Tennessee to perform in vaudeville (By the Light of the Silvery Moon).  Arriving in Superior, Wisconsin, he met a pretty young woman named Ethel Milne and fell in love (Dream Girl).  Some months after their marriage, with dreams of success, the couple went on the road with their own vaudeville act, (Made In America; Mary, You're A Little Bit Old Fashioned and Alexanders Ragtime Band).
In time, Frank and Ethel settled down in Grand Rapids, Minnesota. In a few years, their two little girls were performing on stage as well (I Never Had A Mammy).  In 1922, the youngest, Frances was born. By the age of two and a half, she was insistent on singing too! (Tie Me To Your Apron Strings Again).   Judy's mother Ethel, trained the girls and they had their own singing/dance act as the Gumm Sisters. (When My Sugar Walks Down the Street).  At night, Frank Gumm sang the girls to sleep (Danny Boy, Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen).
The Gumm family moved to California in 1926, and on the way Ethel performed a song on stage which always made Baby (Judy) cry, called ""I've Been Saving For a Rainy Day.""  The Gumms had one favorite song that every one of them performed at one time or another (Carolina in the Morning).

The name of this ill-used stream, once fresh and fleet, now a mere sluggish and plague-breeding sewer, is traced by some to the Anglo-Saxon fleotan, ""to float;"" and by others, to the Saxon fleot, or flod, ""a flood."" The sources of the river Fleet are on the high lands of Hampstead and Highgate, and the chief of them rise near Caen Wood. The Fleet was fed by the Oldborne, which rose, says Stow, ""where now the Bars do stand,"" and ran down to Old Borne Bridge, and into the River of Wells or Turnmill Brook. The Fleet was also fed by all the springs of Clerkenwell, such as Clerkenwell itself, Skinner's Well, Fogg's Well, Tod's Well, Loder's Well, Rad Well (near the Charterhouse), and the Horse Pool, at Smithfield.
""The principal spring of the Fleet,"" says Mr. Pinks, ""rises in a secluded lane at the rear of Caen Wood, the seat of Lord Mansfield; another is on the left of a footpath leading thence to Highgate; and the tiny brooklet formed by its waters communicates by a small arch with a reservoir, the first of seven storage-ponds, on different levels, belonging to the Hampstead Water Company. Another of the spring-heads rises in the midst of Caen Wood. All three springs are diverted so as to fill the reservoirs above mentioned, a small stream carrying off the redundant water, which is very trifling, except in wet seasons. A fourth spring flows from the Vale of Health, at Hampstead, in a narrow channel, to another of the reservoirs, which are connected by means of large pipes passing from one to another. At a lower level the main stream meanders through the fields between Haverstock Hill and Kentish Town, in a wide, deep, and rugged channel, indicating that a considerable body of water must have originally flowed through it with a rapid current. The name of Kentish Town, which was formerly a mere country village, is supplied by tradition, which ascribes its origin to the place being situated on the bank of a stream (the river Fleet) which rose among the hills about Caen or Ken Wood, and which was formerly called Ken or Caen Ditch, hence Ken Ditch Town, the Town of Ken Ditch, or Kentish Town. But the correctness of this etymology has been questioned by at least one historian. The Fleet passes on through Kentish Town, its course there being much hidden, and, flowing in a south-east direction, it passes under the Regent's Canal to St. Pancras, where, until the year 1766, when it was arched over, it bore the name of Pancras Wash. Running at the foot of the gardens in the rear of the houses in the Old St. Pancras Road, it arrives at Battle Bridge, and so makes its entrance into Clerkenwell. Following the line of the Bagnigge Wells Road, its covered course nearly coincides with the parochial boundary in this direction. Passing in an artificial channel alongside the western boundary wall of the House of Correction, its course lies beneath the valley between Turnmill Street and Saffron Hill; thence, under Farringdon Street and Bridge Street, emptying itself into the Thames on the western side of Blackfriars Bridge."" It was called ""the River of Wells"" as early as the days of William the Conqueror.
The Fleet seems early to have become impure, and hardly fit to drink, for, in 1290 (Edward I.), the prior of a Carmelite house in Whitefriars complained of the noxious exhalations, the miasma of which had killed many of the hooded brethren, and the corruption of which overpowered the odours of the incense. The Black Friars and the Bishop of Salisbury, whose palace was in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, also signed the same doleful petition. Mr. Pinks, with whom we do not in this case altogether agree, thinks that the Fleet was called the Holeburne, or burne of the Hollow, above Holborn Bridge; and the Fleet, between Holborn Bridge and its embouchure. The Holeburne is distinctly mentioned in Domesday Book.
In the register of the Nunnery of St. Mary, Clerkenwell, of the time of Richard I. or John, the oldest cartulary extant, mention is made of a meadow near Holeburne, and of a ditch that led from Holeburne to the mill of the nuns.

Supermarine
Spitfire
There is, without a doubt, that the Supermarine  Spitfire was one of the most famous of all World War Two aircraft. It was  glamorized by the media, and children young and old would look up towards  the skies watching a dogfight or see a squadron of RAF fighters come swarming  in towards a formation of German bombers. They would hardly know one aircraft  from another, but they would all include a Spitfire in their exclamations.  ""It's a Spitfire"" or ""D'yer see that Spitfire shoot that bomber down, weeeeeooooooow"".
But the Spitfire that we knew at the end  of the war was far different from the version that flew in the Battle of  Britain and even to that of pre 1939 Spitfires. At wars end, the Supermarine  Spitfire was a streamlined fighting machine, it was the mainstay of Fighter  Command, but let us not take anything away from the Hurricane which in  itself was a superb aircraft.
Supermarine gained their experience in  fast and manoeuvrable aircraft with experience gained in winning the Schneider  Trophy Air Races. But the concept of the Spitfire really began way back  in 1930 when Supermarine submitted their design (Westland and Blackburn  Aircraft Companies also submitted designs) in relation for the construction  of an all metal type fighter aircraft that would have a fabric covered  wing area as well as tailplane sections. This was to comply with specification  F.7/30.
The wings were of gull wing design, the  fixed undercarriage had streamlined fairings over the wheels, and it was  powered by a single Rolls Royce Goshawk engine which provided just 600  horsepower giving the Type 224 a top speed of only 228 miles per hour (367  kph).  Armament was two .303 guns in the fuselage and one in each  of the wheel fairings. The 224 first took to the air on 19th February 1934,  and because of its poor performance it failed to be accepted as a potential  fighter aircraft. Supermarine had great plans for the Type 224, but because  of its failure in every department, the company had to do something quick  to be able to prove to the authorities that they were capable of producing  a good hard working fighter aircraft.
THE TYPE 300 - SPITFIRE MK I - SPITFIRE  MK II - SPITFIRE MK III
Supermarine had for some time enjoyed  success in aircraft design and with many aircraft bearing similarities  to the Schneider successes including the 224, something different had to  be designed. Sydney Camm was now in the process of designing the Hurricane  at Hawker's works at Weybridge. Naturally Supermarine knew of this and  it soon became apparent as to the design and the potential of the Hurricane.
Reginald Mitchell set about in designing  a completely new type of aircraft. They stayed with the required specifications  as called by F.7/30 in producing a metal bodied cantilever type fighter  aircraft. Mitchell decided that the wings should be metal as well as the  fuselage believing that fabric covered wings on an aircraft with a metal  body at high speed would provide the aircraft with weak spots. The cockpit  of the aircraft was enclosed and formed part of the design lines of the  body, while the narrow undercarriage was retractable with the wheel being  lifted into wheel wells under the wings.
The design was a streamlined, yet strong,  an  aircraft that had all areas that would cause any form of resistance  to wind removed. It was claimed, as the aircraft made its early test flights  that not only did this Type 300 look exciting it was yet the most attractive  aircraft ever designed.
By the end of 1934 the Type 300 was eventually ordered as a prototype, and  further testing was done and it was put through a series of strenuous tests.  By 1935, the aircraft with its Rolls Royce PV12 now glycol cooled engine  (this engine was later to be known as the Merlin), and four .303 Browning  machine guns in each wing gave a performance good, or maybe even better  than expected.
The aircraft flew on official tests in  March 1936, and by June of the same year, and by now the name Type 300  had been dropped and the name Spitfire had been officially adopted, the  aircraft went into production as Spitfire Mk I. Already Rolls Royce had  reworked the Merlin power unit and the Merlin II and III had the power  output increased to 1,000 hp. The basic design was a 12 cylinder unit in  V formation. The first Spitfire I's began flying on May 14th 1938 with  the first of them going into service use by the RAF in August.
Flying  the Spitfire was like driving a sports car. It was faster than the old  Hurricane , much more delicate. You couldn't roll it very fast, but you  could make it go up and down much easier. A perfect lady. It wouldn't do  anything wrong. The Hurricane would drop a wing if you stalled it coming  in, but a Spitfire would come wafting down. You couldn't snap it into a  spin. Beautiful to fly, although very stiff on the ailerons - you had to  jam your elbow against the side to get the leverag",Supermarine; Supermarine Aviation; Supermarine Aviation Works Ltd.; Supermarine,Supermarine,Supermarine.,1,1

Six of the best Richard Briers TV roles - video
From the Good Life to If You See God, Tell Him, Briers' best work proves that while making everyone else laugh, he never took himself too seriously...

Marriage Lines (1961-1966)
Briers' breakthrough was as the lead in BBC comedy Marriage Lines, opposite Prunella Scales. The show followed newlyweds George and Kate Starling as they attempted to get to grips with married life and start a family. Marriage Lines ran for five series and was later adapted into a radio play.
The Good Life (1975-1978)
Briers' turn as boyish rogue Tom Good in classic BBC sitcom The Good Life is the one he'll remain best known for. His chemistry with onscreen wife Felicity Kendal was matched by a playful frisson with Penelope Keith’s high-maintenance next door neighbour Margo Leadbetter.
Set in Surbiton, The Good Life followed Tom and Barbara Good as they quit the rat race to turn their suburban house and garden into a self-sufficient smallholding. The series starts on Tom's 40th birthday when he decides to pack in his job.
Watch a clip from the first ever episode...
Roobarb/Roobarb and Custard too (1974, 2005)
Briers narrated cult 70s cartoon Roobarb, about the eponymous green dog and his pink feline rival, Custard. Roughly drawn with marker pens in Bob Godfrey's inimitable style, it was the first fully animated British series and proved hugely popular during the 1970s, returning for a new series in 2005.
Ever Decreasing Circles (1984-1989)
Briers played Martin Bryce, an obsessive middle-aged man at the centre of his community – until his new neighbour, Paul (Peter Egan), arrived to make waves in his small suburban pond. Penelope Wilton was Martin's long-suffering but patient wife, Ann, who put up with him for four series. 
If You See God, Tell Him (1993)
This brilliantly black BBC1 comedy passed many people by but it's a bizarre little gem. Briers is Godfrey Spry, whose life is transformed after he is hit on the head by falling rubble. Now with just a 30-second attention span, Godfrey finds himself believing in and repeating everything he's told by TV ads – and is all the happier for it. Even the horrible demise of his wife (""stoned to death by a mob of drunken soccer fans"" we're told) is not enough to quash his newfound upbeat outlook on life. Adrian Edmonson and Imelda Staunton starred as Godfrey's nephew and niece.
Monarch of the Glen (2000-2005)
Briers played Scottish eccentric Hector in Sunday teatime treat Monarch of the Glen. The drama – which also starred Downton Abbey writer-to-be Julian Fellowes, as well as Alastair Mackenzie, Dawn Steele and Susan Hampshire – followed Archie, Hector's son, who was forced return to his childhood home to look after his inherited estate, Glenbogle. Hector appeared in the first three series – before accidentally blowing himself up in a fishing accident...

qz_4945,Which South African fast bowler had the nickname White Lightning,"Cream of the Crop - Fast Bowlers
Cream of the Crop - Fast Bowlers
Feature Article by Peter Argent
All fast bowlers like seeing the batsman at the other end of the pitch, ducking and weaving due to the pace of an express delivery.
Looking at the strength of the Australian side, many critics and lovers of the game would agree the current Aussie pace bowling  attack rates with the best yet.  Their effect would compare favourably with any of the great fast bowling line-ups.
Glenn McGrath, the current ï¿½Rolls Royceï¿½ of the Australian pace attack, is the pre-eminent fast bowler in world cricket today. He will (if injury doesnï¿½t interfere) for a time, become the games greatest all time wicket taker. Blonde bombshell Brett Lee, who exploded onto the international scene against India with a five  wicket haul in the Boxing Day Test of 1999, is frighteningly quick. South Australian Jason Gillespie, has overcome more than most to ensure he has a baggygreen cap on his head. What these players give the Australian captain is a mean, aggressive and respected trio to scare the life out of any top-order batting line up in the game.
The last time an Australian side had such a venomous attack, was when Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, were  scaring the life out of anyone with a piece of willow in their hands during the early and mid 70s. These two men, fired the passions of a generation of Australian cricketers, bringing many spectators through the gate to see them take the game up to any batsman they encountered.
Prior to this, the years immediately after Word War II created another exceptional pair of pacemen named Ray  Lindwall and Keith Miller. Miller; a tall dark haired charismatic man, who could have come off the pages of a ï¿½Boys Ownï¿½ book, played Aussie Rules in Melbourne before moving up to Sydney. He was also an excellent middle order batsman.  With the ball he could paralyze an opposition batting side in a matter of a couple of overs.
Lindwall was shorter, but as athletic as Miller and had one of the smoothest run-ups in the game. Together  they made a potent pair.  Lindwall also played first-grade rugby league for St George, before being enticed to move to Brisbane amd focussing more on his cricket. 
Delving even further into history, the ï¿½Big Shipï¿½ Warwick Armstrong, captain of the Australian team during the early 1900ï¿½s, had a couple of quick men that played havoc with the English batsmen. Jack Gregory, who was a  member of the great Gregory cricketing family, ï¿½had little rhythm in his approach, but abundant vigor and venom, all thunder and lightning like and electric storm.ï¿½ according to legendary writer Johnny Moyes.   Besides his bowling abilities, Bill Oï¿½Rielly rated him as the best slips fieldsman that he had ever seen. His all-round skill was topped off with some destructive efforts with the bat, this included a century in 135 minutes, in the  Melbourne test of 1921. Later, against the South Africanï¿½s, the fastest Australian test century of all time, in 70 minutes.
Gregoryï¿½s partner at the time Ted McDonald, was a more fluent quick bowler. The great English writer Neville Carduss, described him as the most aesthetically pleasing quick bowler in the world. He was an enigma who was to play a mere eleven tests for Australia before moving to English County ranks, after a term in the  Lancashire League. There was also a misrepresentation that he was credited with the creation of leg-theory and the subsequent intervention of ï¿½Bodylineï¿½. This first Australian brutal pairing, became members of Wisdenï¿½s 1922, five cricketers of the year, for their part in Australiaï¿½s eight straight test wins, during this period.
Australia has not had a monopoly on fast bowling pairings over the years.  In the Caribbean, after many years  of relying predominately on spin bowlers, the West Indies unleashed a pair of pace men named Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith, in the early 1960s. Hall, whose muscular athletic body was described by many, as perfectly suited to the pursuit of fast bowling.  With unnerving pace in 48 tests for the West Indies side, he captured many wickets.
Barbadian Charlie Griffith, had some question marks about the legitimacy of his action, but was extremely fast  as Indian captain Nari Contractor unfortunately discovered. After being struck near the right temple by Griffiths with a rising delivery, he required a series of operations to save his life. It wasnï¿½t only the Indian he caused to tremble. Many batsmen from England in 1963 and against Australia during their tour of 1965, felt like they were preparing for combat. During the latter tour, Richie Benaud, commentating on the series, caused some  controversy by suggesting during the first test that he was a ï¿½chucker.ï¿½
Arriving in the mid 1970s, was an Antiguan called Andy Roberts and an athletic Jamaican named Michael Holding. They helped the West Indies become a world power in cricket. Roberts, had the ability to do most thing",Allan Donald; Allan Donald; Allan Anthony Donald,Peter,Peter Siddle,0,0
qz_4991,Another name for the Holy Wars between the  Christian states of Europe against the Saracens,"Overview of the Crusades
Overview of the Crusades
By   Wikipedia.org
CBN.com -- Historically, the Crusades were a series of several military campaigns, usually sanctioned by the Papacy, that took place during the 11th through 13th centuries. Originally, they were Roman Catholic endeavors to re-capture the Holy Land from the Muslims. Some were directed against other Christians, such as the Fourth Crusade against Constantinople and the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars of southern France.
In a broader sense, ""crusade"" can be used, always in a rhetorical and metaphorical sense, to identify as righteous any war that is given a religious justification (""Gott mit uns,"" ""God with us"") and asserted to be holy (""jihad"" being the term used in specifically Muslim contexts).
Ardent activists may also refer to their causes as ""crusades,"" as in the ""Crusade against Adult Illiteracy,"" or a ""Crusade against Littering."" In recent years, however, there has been some heightened awareness among Westerners to the historical and political problems with the use of the term ""crusade"", and where any casual respect for Muslim culture has relevance, the term has largely fallen into disuse. A more sophisticated (youthful) use of the term may (sarcastictically or pejoratively) characterize the zealotry of agenda promoters, for example with the monicker ""Public Crusader"" or the campaigns ""Crusade for women's rights,"" and the ""Crusade for prayer in public schools.""

Historical background
The origins of the crusades lie in Western developments earlier in the Middle Ages, as well as the deteriorating situation of the Byzantine Empire. The breakdown of the Carolingian Empire in the later 9th century, combined with the relative stabilization of local European borders after the Christianization of the Vikings, Slavs, and Magyars, meant that there was an entire class of warriors who now had very little to do but fight among themselves and terrorize the peasant population. The Church tried to stem this violence with the Peace and Truce of God movements, forbidding violence against certain people at certain times of the year. This was somewhat successful, but trained warriors always sought an outlet for their violence. A plea for help from the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I in opposing Muslim attacks thus fell on ready ears.
One later outlet was the Reconquista in Spain, which at times occupied Spanish knights and some mercenaries from elsewhere in Europe in the fight against the Islamic Moors. In 1063, Pope Alexander II had given papal blessing to Spanish Christians in their wars against the Muslims, granting both a papal standard (the vexillum sancti Petri) and an indulgence to those who were killed in battle.
This background in the Christian West must be matched with that in the Muslim East. Muslim presence in the Holy Land goes back to the initial Arab conquest of Palestine in the 7th century. This did not interfere much with pilgrimage to Christian holy sites or the security of monasteries and Christian communities in the Holy Land of Christendom, and western Europeans were not much concerned with the loss of far-away Jerusalem when, in the ensuing decades and centuries, they were themselves faced with invasions by Muslims and other hostile non-Christians such as the Vikings and Magyars. However, the Muslim armies' successes were putting strong pressure on the Eastern Orthodox Byzantine Empire.
A turning point in western attitudes towards the east came in the year 1009, when the Fatimid caliph of Cairo, al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah, had the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem destroyed. His successor permitted the Byzantine Empire to rebuild it under stringent circumstances, and pilgrimage was again permitted, but many stories began to be circulated in the West about the cruelty of Muslims toward Christian pilgrims; these rumors then played an important role in the development of the crusades later in the century.
Historical context
It is necessary to look for the origin of a crusading ideal in the struggle between Christians and Moslems in Spain and consider how the idea of a holy war emerged from this background. — Norman F. Cantor
The trigger for the First Crusade was Emperor Alexius I's appeal to Pope Urban II for mercenaries to help him resist Muslim advances into territory of the Byzantine Empire. Although the East-West Schism was brewing between the Catholic Western church and the Greek Orthodox Eastern church, Alexius I expected some help from a fellow Christian. However, the response was much larger, and less helpful, than Alexius I desired, as the Pope called for a large invasion force to not merely defend the Byzantine Empire but also retake Jerusalem.
When the First Crusade was preached in 1095, the Christian princes of northern Iberia had been fighting their way out of the mountains of Galicia and Asturias, the Basque country and Navarre, with increasing success, for about a hundred years.

qz_5075,Which famous resident resides at Highgrove House?,"ROYALTY: Kate and William’s Kensington Palace home in London – Apartment 1A
ROYALTY: Kate and William’s Kensington Palace home in London – Apartment 1A
07
2013
Here’s some news and photos of the renovated apartment “1A” at Kensington Palace in London, which the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and baby Prince George are moving into…
Kensington Palace is a royal residence, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, set in Kensington Gardens, in the central Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London, England, and home to several members of the British royal family due to the large capacity for state rooms, apartments and cottages.
 
Kate and William are moving into Apartment 1A, circled:
 
Kensington Palace, formerly known as Nottingham House, was originally a Jacobean mansion built in 1605, and purchased by King William III and Queen Mary II  who reigned jointly as “ William and Mary ” from 1689.
They commissioned Christopher Wren to expand and update the palace, making it the favourite royal residence for about seventy years. Read more history here .
 
Here’s the palace in 1961:
 
It was the official residence of William’s mother,  Princess Diana . Apartments 8 and 9 were combined into one for the newlyweds Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, and the princess continued living there until her death in 1997.
Princes William and Harry primarily grew up there, and attended prep schools nearby, as well as their father’s home, Highgrove House ( see pictures here ).
 
 
Here’s what we know about Kate and William’s refurbished home so far:
The Kensington Palace apartment – Apartment 1A – was once home to Princess Margaret (until her death in 2002) and her former husband, famed photographer, Lord Snowdon .
It has its own large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren in the 17th century for King William and Queen Mary.
Apparently Kate was inspired by Princess Mary of Denmark when she visited Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, and the combination of traditional with modern design. See some photos here .
It has now been redesigned and opened up to give around 20 rooms instead of the original 30 rooms. Lord Snowden’s former darkroom has been replaced with staff and utility rooms.
The £1-1.5 million restoration project was done over 18 months, with about £600,000 going on refurbishment, and £400,000 on repairing the roof. The home, over four-floors, now includes:
five reception rooms
three bedrooms with ‘his and hers’ dressing rooms and bathrooms
a day and a night nursery for Prince George, with an adjacent bedroom for his nanny Jessie Webb
three kitchens – one for the family on the ground floor and two for staff
the entrance hall includes two 19th-century Corinthian lamps and, on loan from the royal treasure chest, a Persian rug worth about $50K
ornate original fixtures such as cornices are combined with elegant neutral tones
updated heating, water and electrical systems and removal of asbestos
underfloor heating, encrypted wifi, a TV projector
a panic room, video cameras in every room room, and mesh curtains on each window designed to catch shattered glass
a basement laundry, storeroom and staff coffee area.
 
The couple previously lived in Nottingham Cottage (see number 9 on the photo below),  a two-bedroom pied-a-terre which was “spruced up” by designer Kelly Hoppen .
Once they move into Apartment 1A, Prince Harry will move out of Clarence House and into the Kensington Palace cottage, or even possibly Apartment 4B which is said to be grander.

qz_5252,What was Jacques Cousteau's mobile oceonagraphic laboratory.,"Jacques Cousteau | Military Wiki | Fandom powered by Wikia
Edit
Cousteau was born on 11 June 1910, in Saint-André-de-Cubzac , Gironde, France to Daniel and Élisabeth Cousteau. He had one brother, Pierre-Antoine . Cousteau completed his preparatory studies at the Collège Stanislas in Paris. In 1930, he entered the École Navale and graduated as a gunnery officer. After an automobile accident cut short his career in naval aviation, Cousteau indulged his interest in the sea.
In Toulon, where he was serving on the Condorcet, Cousteau carried out his first underwater experiments, thanks to his friend Philippe Tailliez who in 1936 lent him some Fernez underwater goggles , predecessors of modern swimming goggles . [1] Cousteau also belonged to the information service of the French Navy , and was sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan (1935–1938) and in the USSR (1939).[ citation needed ]
On 12 July 1937 he married Simone Melchior , with whom he had two sons, Jean-Michel (born 1938) and Philippe (1940–1979). His sons took part in the adventures of the Calypso . In 1991, one year after his wife Simone's death from cancer, he married Francine Triplet . They already had a daughter Diane Cousteau (born 1980) and a son Pierre-Yves Cousteau (born 1982), born during Cousteau's marriage to his first wife.
Early 1940s: Innovation of modern underwater diving
Edit
The years of World War II were decisive for the history of diving. After the armistice of 1940 , the family of Simone and Jacques-Yves Cousteau took refuge in Megève , where he became a friend of the Ichac family who also lived there. Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Marcel Ichac shared the same desire to reveal to the general public unknown and inaccessible places — for Cousteau the underwater world and for Ichac the high mountains. The two neighbors took the first ex-aequo prize of the Congress of Documentary Film in 1943, for the first French underwater film: Par dix-huit mètres de fond (18 meters deep), made without breathing apparatus the previous year in the Embiez islands ( Var ) with Philippe Tailliez and Frédéric Dumas , using a depth-pressure-proof camera case developed by mechanical engineer Léon Vèche (engineer of Arts and Métiers and the Naval College).
In 1943, they made the film Épaves (Shipwrecks), in which they used two of the very first Aqua-Lung prototypes. These prototypes were made in Boulogne-Billancourt by the Air Liquide company, following instructions from Cousteau and Émile Gagnan . [2] When making Épaves, Cousteau could not find the necessary blank reels of movie film, but had to buy hundreds of small still camera film reels the same width, intended for a make of child's camera, and cemented them together to make long reels. [3] [4]
Having kept bonds with the English speakers (he spent part of his childhood in the United States and usually spoke English) and with French soldiers in North Africa (under Admiral Lemonnier ), Jacques-Yves Cousteau (whose villa ""Baobab"" at Sanary ( Var ) was opposite Admiral Darlan 's villa ""Reine""), helped the French Navy to join again with the Allies; he assembled a commando operation against the Italian espionage services in France, and received several military decorations for his deeds. At that time, he kept his distance from his brother Pierre-Antoine Cousteau , a ""pen anti-semite"" who wrote the collaborationist newspaper Je suis partout (I am everywhere) and who received the death sentence in 1946. However, this was later commuted to a life sentence, and Pierre-Antoine was released in 1954.
During the 1940s, Cousteau is credited with improving the aqua-lung design which gave birth to the open-circuit scuba technology used today. According to his first book, The Silent World: A Story of Undersea Discovery and Adventure (1953), Cousteau started diving with Fernez goggles in 1936, and in 1939 used the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus invented in 1926 by Commander Yves le Prieur . [3] Cousteau was not satisfied with the length of time he could spend underwater with the Le Prieur apparatus so he improved it to extend underwater duration by adding a demand regulator , invented in 1942 by Émile Gagnan. [3] In 1943 Cousteau tried out the first prototype aqua-lung which finally made extended underwater exploration possible.
Late 1940s: GERS and Élie Monnier
Edit
In 1946, Cousteau and Tailliez showed the film ""Épaves"" to Admiral Lemonnier, and the admiral gave them the responsibility of setting up the Groupement de Recherches Sous-marines (GRS) (Underwater Research Group) of the French Navy in Toulon. A little later it became the GERS (Groupe d'Études et de Recherches Sous-Marines, = Underwater Studies and Research Group), then the COMISMER (""COMmandement des Interventions Sous la MER"", = ""Undersea Interventions Command""), and finally more recently the CEPHISMER. In 1947, Chief Petty Officer Maurice Fargues became the first diver to die using an aqualung while attempting a new depth record with the GERS near ",Calypso; Calypso; Callypso; Calipso; Calypsos; Kalypso; Calypso (disambiguation),Calypso,Calypso.,1,1

(You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head. | Notes and Queries | guardian.co.uk
STAGE AND SCREEN
Why did Shakespeare make Julius Caesar's last words the Latin 'Et tu, Brute?' when Suetonius tells us they were the Greek 'Kai su, teknon?' (You too, my son?)? Plutarch, on the other hand, says that Caesar died in silence, pulling his toga over his head.
THE answer is simple. The ancient historians such as Suetonius and Plutarch were as much in the entertainment business as the great playwright. Phrases like Suetonius's 'Kai su, teknon' and Plutarch's dramatic descriptions, were as much for the enjoyment of the reader/listener as for the true recording of fact. Shakespeare simply used the line 'Et tu Brute' because it suited his dramatic purpose, just as Plutarch and Suetonius had used what suited them. Personally, I suspect Julius Caesar's last words were 'aaaaaaaaaaah'.
Jonathan Munn, Whitchurch, Cardiff.
I THINK it's generally accepted that Caesar's dying words were the Greek 'Kai su, teknon'. Romans of his class moved easily between Latin and Greek. But it's important to recognise that he was not asking 'You too, my son?' The words 'Kai su' - found in Greek comedy and on mosaics - mean 'Screw you!' and the 'teknon' ('kid') just makes it fiercer.
Greg Rowe, The Queen's College, Oxford.
I MUST point out that Shakespeare does not make Caesar's last words 'Et tu, Brute?' Shakespeare gives him another three words after the famous quotation: 'Then fall Caesar!'
Eric Standidge, London SE10.
As we all know, the old Greek language doesn't have anything to do with a modern Greek language and no Greeks can understand the old one. The only people who do understand it are Albanians. The etymology of the word KAI SU TEKNON (Kai s'u te knon)means Cry like you are singing. Kai -Cray SU- like you Te`knon- singing Shakespeare was in Albania a few times and he maybe understood the Albanian language.
Lamun Dardanian, Kosova Albania

qz_5801,What was the name of the World War I fighter ace nicknamed the Red Baron?,"The Red Baron (2008)
Author: Ralfscheapthrill
from Berlin
Few days ago I read an interview with Schweighöfer in which he's wondering why ""The Red Baron"" didn't get any subsidies. ""Maybe they didn't like the script"". They were right! And I don't think, the script was too controversial... I wish, it'd be. It's a pity that private financed productions like ""As far as my feet will carry me"" or even Vilsmaier's ""Marlene"" and now ""The Red Baron"" have producer's that are obviously willing to make the best movies they can, even without public money. they spent their budget on the cast, effects, good looks but they don't have a clue what to do with their values. They hire authors and directors who turn out to be just unable to cope with their projects. And most of the critics just complain about historical facts... I don't get it. It's a movie! But a badly told one. If you want to make a movie about a world war pilot who tries to be the best, then tell us, how he does it. And not in the main case, how he tries to win a nurse's heart! There are a lot of good love stories around, but THIS is the story of guy who liked to fly and shoot down enemies. If you pick it, stick to it. Don't be ashamed of your choice. It's quite funny to see a few quite impressing battle scenes, but the battles that mattered for the story are simply ignored. They get on the plane. Cut. Hospital. Everything that matters in the story is in the dialogs, not in actions. And even the important dialogs are filmed in cowardly undramatic distant shots... A waste of talent, chances and money.

qz_6046,In Egyptian myth who was the God of chaos and disorder?,"Seth
Seth
The gods Seth (left) and Horus (right) adoring Ramesses
in the small temple at Abu Simbel
Seth is a warrior god of Egyptian mythology. He is opposed to the harmony of things and is capable of  destroying all life. He is a figure of confusion and chaos. Although initially regarded as a fairly benevolent god, in later Egyptian belief Seth was regarded as a demonic figure.
Seth is one of the most complex and ambiguous Egyptian gods; myths about Seth depict him as ambitious, scheming, manipulative, and a murderer. In many ways, Seth resembles a devil in Judeo-Christian belief.
Seth is not a creator god, but Ra ther a god of the desert and barren lands. He is therefore jealous of his brother Horus , who inherited the fertile lands of Egypt.  It is also called the ""red god, the god of great power"", Master of thunder, lightning and disorder, the god of the desert and aridity, foreign countries: Egyptians both revered and feared this dread god. Seth was worshiped in secret cults in Ancient Egypt that p Ra cticed human sacrifice. These sects were suppressed by the official religion, but persisted throughout the centuries.
Indeed Seth was cent Ra l to the Osiris myth, in which Osiris was sacrificed and then reborn, in a symbolic representation of the seasons and the rebirth of the land as a result of the annual Nile flooding. Seth murdered his brother Osiris out of jealousy by drowning Osiris in the Nile. Osiris 's wife Isis , found the body and buried him which angered Seth, who then desec Ra ted the body by cutting it into pieces and scattering it throughout Egypt. Isis , indefatigable widow, found thirteen of the fourteen parts of her beloved (The missing part is the sex of Osiris , on this occasion called her ""talisman""). Then Isis rebuilds Osiris , breathes the breath of eternal life into him, and by magic produces a son, Horus (Hor).
Driven by his infinite jealousy, Seth is also the enemy of Horus , the postmortem son born to Isis and Osiris . Horus is the legal heir to the crown of Egypt but Seth refuses to pay homage, and seizes power by force. A tribunal of the gods is convened by Horus 's mother Isis at which the sun god Ra presides. Thoth acts as notary and records the proceedings.
The mills of the gods grind slowly and eighty years pass while the gods debate whether Seth or Horus should prevail.  As the debates are just going in circles, with no clear winner, Toth turns to the goddess Sais, who is renowned for her wisdom. Her answer is unambiguous: the crown back to Horus . However, to avoid penalizing Seth, Neith proposes to offer the goddesses Anat and Astarte as wives.
But Seth does not accept this compromise and the debate continues. Isis objects, and is barred from the tribunal on orders of Seth. But Isis returns in disguise, as a beautiful young woman who catches the eye of Seth. Seth is dist Ra cted by her beauty and confides in the disguised Isis , that Horus is the legitimate heir. At this point the ruse is revealed and Ra , who had previously supported Seth realizes that he is imprudent and unworthy of the crown because he was so quick to confide in a st Ra nger. Ra then takes the crown away from Seth and places it on Horus himself.
But Seth, eternally jealous, still would not give up and challenged Horus to games to decide the winner. And so the battle continues. Ra , anxious to bring peace between the uncle and nephew, invites them to a banquet. Seth pretends to be reconciled to Horus , and then invites Horus to his house. But while Horus is sleeping, Seth steals Horus 's semen (I will leave the details out) in an effort to feminize Horus and make him unworthy to rule. The gods are once again torn by disputes, until Osiris finally intervenes. As god of vegetation Osiris threatens to cut off the life force to Egypt is Seth does not relent (though it is unclear why this would concern him too much since he is regarded as a god of destruction) and so in the end Horus prevails.
But Seth is not forgotten.  Placed alongside Ra , he became ""the one who screams in the sky"" to be carried up to the creator god, to thunder in the sky, and be feared. In this capacity, Seth is regarded as defender of Ra 's solar boat as he journeys through the sky.",Seth; Seth (Bible); Seth (bible); Seth; שֵׁת; Pillars of the sons of Seth; Sheis; Šet,Seth,Seth.,1,1
qz_6079,Which method of painting consists of applying pigment to wet plaster?,"Media
Wood
Ceramics
The materials and techniques selected define the forms of visual expression the artist or designer can develop in their work. The various media offer both distinctive limitations and opportunities for the artist/designer. For this reason we need to look at the media traditionally used in order to understand the context in which visual language evolves. We will do this before we begin to examine the actual styles that have developed historically.
Painting and Related Techniques
Painting involves applying color to a surface. The colors were traditionally earth pigments which were ground into a fine powder and then mixed with a medium, usually a liquid, so they can be applied to a surface. Today there are also some artificial compounds used as pigments. The choice of the medium and the method by which the color is applied have important effects on the characteristics of the finished work, since each medium has its own limitations and potentials.
We will discuss many different painting related media:
Encaustic
Acrylic paints
Collage
The    oldest examples of painting date to more than 20,000 B.C, and can be found in    the caves    in southern France . The best known of these caves is at Lascaux, although    there are many others. These portraits of animals and hunters were probably    done with a mixture of minerals such as ochre, with animal fat used as the medium.    Rock paintings in this technique can be seen in many parts of the world.
Encaustic
In  the technique known as encaustic ,  the medium for the powdered color is hot wax which is painted onto a wood surface  with a brush. It is then smoothed with a metal instrument resembling a spoon,  and then blended and set over a flame to soften and set the colors into the wood.  This method produces durable colors and permits sculptural modeling of the paint surface. Because of the wax medium,  the colors are semi-translucent and look fresh and lively. This technique is rare  today, but it was practiced in late Roman times; for example, we have burial portraits  from Faiyum, Egypt, 2nd century, A.D.
Fresco Secco
In  the dry plaster or ""fresco secco"" technique, pigments are usually mixed with water,  although other substances might also be used. The paint is then applied to a dry  plaster wall which has been wetted down with water. Since the plaster is relatively  dry, it is non-absorbent, and the pigment adheres to the surface of the plaster.  This technique differs from true fresco (described below) in several ways. The  colors tend to flake off the surface of the plaster. The colors have a harder  and more brilliant appearance and tend to be lighter in value than those in true  fresco. Advantages of the technique are that the painting can be done more slowly  and carefully, and changes can be made simply by over-painting, since colors are  opaque. Examples: Egyptian  murals , 2500-1000 B.C.
Fresco
Fresco, also known as Buon Fresco or True Fresco, entails painting on  freshly spread, moist plaster. First, layers of plaster are applied to the surface.  While the final layer is still wet, the artist applies the colors, which are earth  pigments mixed with water. The colors penetrate the wet plaster and combine chemically  with it, producing a painted surface which does not peel when exposed to moisture.  As the paint must be painted on wet plaster, the amount of plaster which may be  put down at one time is limited to what can be painted at one sitting. Often lines  can be seen in frescos around an area which was one day's work. The painting must  be done rapidly and without mistakes. It produces a mat surface with fairly desaturated  colors. This technique was perfected in Renaissance Italy. Examples include Roman wall paintings at Pompeii, 1st century A.D ; Giotto's Arena Chapel at Padua , 14th C.; Michelangelo's  Sistine Chapel ceiling , 16th C.
Egg Tempera
In  this method, the pigment is mixed with egg yolk or both the yolk and white of  an egg. It is thinned with water and applied to a gesso ground (plaster mixed  with a binding) on a panel. It was also used on parchment or paper to illustrate  or embellish books in the era before the 15th century development of the printing  press. This type of painting dries very quickly and produces an opaque, matte  surface. The colors tend to dry to a lighter value than they appear when wet.  The colors produced are bright and saturated. Modeling is achieved by hatching.  Egg tempera was used for panel painting until the 15th century. Examples of artists  that worked in egg tempera include Cimabue (14th C.); Duccio (14th C.); Andrew  Wyeth (20th C.) Islamic and Medieval miniature paintings in books and manuscripts  are another important class of egg tempera paintings; the celtic Book  of Kells is a well-known early example, as is the Book  of Hours commissioned by the Duc du Berry in the 14th century.

The Archers: Top 10 storylines
For 65 years The Archers has brought to the airwaves an everyday tale of country folk. But among those everyday tales the Radio 4 drama has interspersed gripping storylines that have kept Archers’ listeners religiously tuning in at 7.03pm for the familiar opening refrain of dum-dee dum-dee dum-dee dum.

1: The Grundys’ Eviction (2000)
The eviction of The Grundys from Grange Farm following bankruptcy was a poignant story that highlighted the real economic struggle for tenant farmers. Forced to move to a council flat in Borchester the move seriously affected this poor farming family – even for non-ferret lovers it was a tough listen when Joe Grundy had to kill his son’s beloved ferrets. Determined to live in Ambridge the family moved into a caravan before renting Keeper’s Cottage. There was a collective cheer from listeners when the family finally moved back to their spiritual home, Grange Farm, in December 2015.
2: Will, Ed and Emma (2001-2015)
For much of the noughties Archers’ listeners were treated to a love triangle between Emma Carter and the Grundy brothers, Ed and Will, that took sibling rivalry to epic levels. It was a tantalising saga seemingly straight out of an Austen novel, in which Emma found herself having to choose between following her heart (the bad brother, Ed) or her head (the good brother, Will). The crux of the tale was Emma’s decision to marry Will in 2004, despite sleeping with Ed on her hen night, leaving the paternity of her son, George, in question – a paternity test confirmed Will was the father, but the marriage broke down nevertheless. After a decade-long love affair full of twists and turns, Ed and Emma finally tied the knot in May 2015.
3: Foot and Mouth Crisis (1956 + 2001)
Brookfield Farm has been the focus of two foot-and-mouth storylines in the drama’s 65 years on the airwaves. In 1956 the farm, then run by Dan Archer, tragically suffered from a foot-and-mouth outbreak in which over 170 cows, sheep and pigs were slaughtered. Not wishing to suffer the same fate as his grandfather, David Archer sealed off Brookfield Farm for six weeks against the national foot-and-mouth outbreak in 2001. Although the farm escaped infection the writers made it very clear to Archers’ listeners that the financial costs to David and Ruth Archer were damagingly high, reflecting the real-life economic impact of the 2001 foot-and-mouth crisis for UK farmers. However, it was noticed that Borchester seemed to be the only county in the UK that wasn’t affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1967!
4: Brian Aldridge’s Lovechild (2002)
Following his various flings with Ambridge ladies it was no surprise when lothario businessman Brian Aldridge had an affair with the doctor’s wife, Siobhan Hathaway. But he didn’t expect her to give birth to his child – a much-wanted son, Ruairi, in November 2002. For months Archers’ listeners waited for Brian to finally confess his adultery and lovechild to his wife of 27 years, Jennifer. But that wasn’t the end of the saga, as things became even more complicated when Siobhan died of cancer in 2007 – her dying wish was that Brian would take care of their son. Cue another awkward conversation between Brian and his long-suffering wife Jennifer. After understandably exploding with rage she magnanimously agreed to care for Brian’s illegitimate and motherless son.
5: Jack Woolley’s Dementia (2003-14)
Over eight years listeners heard the subtle decline of local businessman Jack Woolley as he slowly succumbed to dementia. It started with confusion over a party invitation back in 2003 and, once the signs of memory loss became more obvious (forgetting names, confusion over whether his beloved dog, Captain, was dead or alive, and not letting his wife, Peggy, into the house due to not recognising her), he was admitted into a home in 2009. Unbeknown to some listeners shortly after Jack Woolley was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in The Archers, the actor who played the character for 31 years, Arnold Peters, found out he was suffering from the same condition. Arnold Peters died on 11 May 2013 following his final appearance in The Archers in July 2011. Jack Woolley died on 2 January 2014.
6: Adam and Ian (2006)
The Archers’ “First Gay Wedding” in December 2006  – a year after civil partnerships became legal in England ­­– between farmer Adam Macy and chef Ian Craig followed the radio drama’s “First Gay Kiss” between the pair in a polytunnel two years earlier. However, Adam and Ian’s relationship hasn’t been plain sailing with The Archers’ writers included homophobic reactions to the gay couple from some Ambridge residents: Sid Perks resigned as cricket captain when he discovered teammate Adam was gay, and Adam’s stepfather, Brian Aldridge, disapproved of his stepson’s homosexuality and threatened not to attend the civil ceremony (",Ambridge; Ambridge; Ambridge (disambiguation),Ambridge,Ambridge.,1,1

Prince Rogers Nelson was an American musician. He performed mononymously as Prince, but has also been known by various other names, among them an unpronounceable symbol '
' (alternatively  spelled out as O(+>) which he used as his name between 1993 and 2000, during which time he was usually referred to as The Artist Formerly Known as Prince, the acronym ""TAFKAP"" or simply The Artist .
Prince was a hugely prolific artist, having released over 900 songs both under his own name and with other artists. He has won seven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame the first year he was eligible in 2004.
In 2004, he was named the top male pop artist of the past 25 years by ARC Rock on the Net , and Rolling Stone ranked Prince #27 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time .
From his early material, rooted in R&B, soul and funk, Prince has expanded his musical palette throughout his career, absorbing many other genres including pop, rock, jazz, new wave, psychedelica and hip hop. Some of his primary influences include Sly Stone, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell, James Brown, Parliament-Funkadelic and Carlos Santana.
The distinctive characteristics of his early-to-mid 1980s work, such as sparse and industrial-sounding drum machine arrangements and the use of synthesizer riffs to serve the role traditionally occupied by horn riffs in earlier R&B, funk and soul music, were called the ""Minneapolis sound"" and have proved very influential.
Musical Career
Early Life
Prince Rogers Nelson was born June 7, 1958 in Minneapolis, Minnesota to John L. Nelson and Matti Shaw. John was a pianist and songwriter, and Matti was a jazz singer. He was named after his father, whose stage name was Prince Rogers, and who performed with a jazz group called the Prince Rogers Trio. In a 1991 Current Affair interview, John L. Nelson stated, “I named my son Prince because I wanted him to do everything I wanted to do.” His childhood nickname was Skipper.
After the birth of his sister Tyka in 1960, Prince's parents gradually drifted apart. After they formally separated when Prince was ten, he had a troubled relationship with his stepfather that resulted in him going to live with his father. Prince lived briefly with his father, but was thrown out after his father found him in bed with a female friend and later he settled in with a neighborhood family, the Andersons, befriending their son, Andre Anderson (later called André Cymone ).
Prince and Anderson joined Prince's cousin Charles Smith in a band called Grand Central that they formed in high school (Smith would later be replaced by Morris Day .) His initial contributions were on keyboard and guitar, but would share vocals with Anderson in what was mainly an instrumental band, playing clubs and parties in the Minneapolis area.
As time went by and Prince's musical interests broadened, he found himself producing the arrangements for the band. Grand Central and started playing original music drawing on a range of influences including Sly & the Family Stone , James Brown , Earth, Wind & Fire , Miles Davis , Parliament-Funkadelic , Carlos Santana and Jimi Hendrix . At one point Prince was a student at the Minnesota Dance Theatre.
In 1976, he started work on a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in a Minneapolis studio. Prince also had the patronage of Owen Husney (of The High Spirits), to whom Moon introduced him, a connection that helped him produce a high-quality demo recording. Husney started contacting major labels and ran a campaign promoting Prince as a star of the future, resulting in a bidding war eventually won by Warner Bros. Records as they were the only label to offer Prince creative control of his songs.
First Steps
Pepé Willie , husband of Prince's cousin, Shantel, was an early influence in Prince's career. Along with Husney , Willie was mentor and manager for Prince during the Grand Central days, and he employed Prince for his own recordings.
In 1977, Willie formed the band 94 East , with Marcy Ingvoldstad and Kristie Lazenberry that would later include André Cymone and Prince. Prince would compose most of the music for Willie 's lyrics and typically played guitar and keyboards in the studio, while also contributing many songs for the group, including Just Another Sucker .
The band recorded an album, Minneapolis Genius – The Historic 1977 Recordings . Although it was not a solo album and was not commercially released until many years later, it is considered Prince's first professional album.

This is the most challenging downhill ski race in the world

It's two weeks before the start of the Sochi Olympics, but if you're on the World Cup men's alpine ski team, the only thing on your mind this weekend is winning the most challenging race of the season, the Streif downhill course at Kitzbuhel, Austria.

Good luck, because the treacherous course will have you airborne 10 seconds out of the starting gate, only to force you to regain your terrestrial turning skills in a split second, while you're hurtling down the hill at 80 miles per hour. The reason is that the Streif was designed for a different time. Combine the route with today's equipment and man-made flakes and you've got the ride of your life. 
Nathaniel Vinton covers downhill racing for the New York Daily News and he's been to Kitzbuhel many times to cover the Streif. ""It's a long downhill on a course that was laid out in the 1930s, a time when the sport wasn't as fast as it is now,"" he says. Skis were made of wood and snow was mostly natural. Now, much of it is manmade.
""It took a lot longer to down it back then. But now it's gotten very, very fast — on a track that wasn't designed for this kind of speed,"" Vinton says.
The course is challenging, the topography shifting all the way down.
""It's a narrow dash through the mountains and it's got some enormous jumps, including one that comes about 10 seconds into the course,"" says Vinton. ""Then there's a very challenging bottom section. It's scary and difficult from top to bottom.""
Vinton should know. He's skied the course, for recreation, he's quick to add. ""I can't compare what I've done to actual racing, but every time I ski it, I can't believe skiers actually race it. It's astonishing.""
The Streif downhill course is steeped in tradition and foreboding. ""On every one of those jumps down the course, there's a separate mythology about the terrible accidents that have happened there and the brave exploits of the winners,"" says Vinton.
So any talk of making the course more safe is fraught with soul-searching. That said, organizers have altered the route a bit for this weekend's race because of warm temperatures. ""There's a very tricky section and they don't think it will be safe to send the racers over it, so they're actually bypassing the bottom section this weekend,"" says Vinton.
The downhill event in alpine racing is all about speed. Top speeds at Kitzbuhel are typically in the 80 miles per hour range. And, in theory, that's not especially fast.
""There are places on the World Cup tour where racers exceed 90 miles per hour,"" Vinton says. ""Last year, a few racers reached 100 miles per hour on a course in Switzerland.""
But Vinton says the Streif track at Kitzbuhel presents a special challenge. ""The racers have to make tricky moves at high speeds. It's one thing just to be in your aerodynamic tuck position going 80 miles per hour. It's a whole different thing to be exhausted after almost two minutes of racing and then have to execute a very technical, difficult turn on one leg.""
The favorite to win this year is American downhiller Bode Miller. ""He's 36 years old and he's won so many trophies and titles in the sport, but the Streif course is the one he hasn't quite got a victory in,"" Vinton says.
Miller is a well-known skier, and he's not your typical downhiller either. ""Every year, it seems he's done something that sort of steals the show: a sort of acrobatic recovery. One year, he skied up on one of the safety fences. So everyone's expecting big things of Bode Miller,"" says Vinton. Fans really got keyed up after Miller won Thurday's training run by a huge margin. Vinton says winning the Streif at Kitzbuhel would be a huge achievement for Miller.
""If he won Kitzbuhel and somehow didn't get to go to the Olympcs, I don't think he would call it a disappointing season,"" he adds.
The Streif course at Kitzbuhel has everything: glitz, crazy Austrian fans, cow bells, and challenging courses. The one thing it doesn't have is women competitors, but Vinton says it used to.
""As skiing got much faster in the 1960s, based on equipment and the snow preparation, they divided the venues between the men and women."" They now compete on separate tours and Kitzbuhel became a men's race. ""There were women that raced the Streif at Kitzbuhel all through the 1930s, 40s and 50s, but it hasn't been the case since."" In fact, one of the most famous performances at Kitzbuhel was by American Andrea Mead-Lawrence, who won the downhill, slalom and combined event","Kitzbühel; Kitzbühel Sportpark Tennis Stadium; Kitzbuhel, Austria; Kitzbuhel; Kitzbühel; Kitzbuel; Kitzbuhl; Kitzbühl; Kitzbuehel, Austria; Kitzbuehel; Kitzbühel, Austria; Kitzbuehl","Kitzbuhel, Austria","Kitzbuhel, Austria.",1,1

Shakespearean Sonnet Basics: Iambic Pentameter and the English Sonnet Style
Shakespeare's sonnets are written predominantly in a meter called iambic pentameter, a rhyme scheme in which each sonnet line consists of ten syllables. The syllables are divided into five pairs called iambs or iambic feet. An iamb is a metrical unit made up of one unstressed syllable followed by one stressed syllable. An example of an iamb would be good BYE. A line of iambic pentameter flows like this:
baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM / baBOOM.
Here are some examples from the sonnets:
When I / do COUNT / the CLOCK / that TELLS / the TIME ( Sonnet 12 )
When IN / dis GRACE / with FOR / tune AND / men�s EYES
I ALL / a LONE / be WEEP / my OUT/ cast STATE ( Sonnet 29 )
Shall I / com PARE/ thee TO / a SUM / mer's DAY?
Thou ART / more LOVE / ly AND / more TEM / per ATE ( Sonnet 18 )
Shakespeare's plays are also written primarily in iambic pentameter, but the lines are unrhymed and not grouped into stanzas. Unrhymed iambic pentameter is called blank verse . It should be noted that there are also many prose passages in Shakespeare�s plays and some lines of trochaic tetrameter , such as the Witches' speeches in Macbeth .
Sonnet Structure
There are fourteen lines in a Shakespearean sonnet. The first twelve lines are divided into three quatrains with four lines each. In the three quatrains the poet establishes a theme or problem and then resolves it in the final two lines, called the couplet. The rhyme scheme of the quatrains is abab cdcd efef. The couplet has the rhyme scheme gg. This sonnet structure is commonly called the English sonnet or the Shakespearean sonnet, to distinguish it from the Italian Petrarchan sonnet form which has two parts: a rhyming octave (abbaabba) and a rhyming sestet (cdcdcd). The Petrarchan sonnet style was extremely popular with Elizabethan sonneteers, much to Shakespeare's disdain (he mocks the conventional and excessive Petrarchan style in Sonnet 130 ).
Only three of Shakespeare's 154 sonnets do not conform to this structure: Sonnet 99 , which has 15 lines; Sonnet 126 , which has 12 lines; and Sonnet 145 , which is written in iambic tetrameter.

How Much Do You Know About the Real ‘Jungle Book’ Animals?
At least one creature featured in the new Disney movie is extinct, and other wild facts about Mowgli’s jungle friends and foes.

The story of Mowgli, a boy living among animals in the Indian forest, remains as vivid and appealing today as it was when Rudyard Kipling included it in The Jungle Book, a series of short fables published in 1894. Mowgli’s adventures have been retold time and again in animated films, television shows, plays, and now a partly live-action Disney feature .
But while the universal tale of friendship, belonging, and community remains steadfast, the state of the animals Kipling featured has not. Even a century ago, the author was concerned with the human impact on nature, and many of the animals he described are now threatened with extinction. Here’s what you should know about the real-life versions of The Jungle Book gang.

Bagheera
Black panthers like Bagheera are not a distinct species, but are simply color variants of the spotted leopards found in Asia and Africa and the jaguars found in South America. Kipling acknowledges this when he describes Bagheera as “inky black all over, but with the panther markings showing up in certain lights like the pattern of watered silk.”

Leopards have the largest distribution of any wild cat in the world, but they are also the most persecuted. That’s likely because leopards can live in places with suboptimal habitat, including on the fringes of cities, where they are more likely to come into contact with people. They are also hunted for the illegal wildlife trade, including for use in traditional Chinese medicine.
“They’re being killed more and taken into captivity more—it’s really becoming a problem,” says Alan Rabinowitz , CEO of Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization.
He and other experts are keeping a close eye on leopard populations to see if they should revise the cat's conservation status, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), from “near threatened” to “vulnerable.”

Baloo may have been inspired by sloth bears, like this rescue animal.

Baloo
The true identity of Kipling’s “sleepy brown bear” is a bit of an enigma: Baloo’s physical description in the book would suggest a sloth bear, but his diet of nuts and honey runs counter to that species’ insect-eating preferences. Baloo’s name, which simply means “bear” in Hindustani, lends no additional clues.
“The problem is that The Jungle Book is fiction, and all of Kipling’s characters are a mixture of imaginary types and real animals, so it’s impossible to know the species for sure,” says Kaori Nagai , a Kipling scholar at the University of Kent. But Kipling did use 19th-century naturalists’ writings while crafting the book, and one of his sources was an 1884 natural history text that notes that the common Indian sloth bear is “as a rule vegetarian.” Given that sloth bears tend to sleep a lot during the day and can be found throughout India, most scholars agree that Baloo likely fits this label. And Disney's 1967 animated movie has Baloo teaching Mowgli to eat ants.
Sloth bears, which are found only in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and India, are currently listed as “vulnerable” by the IUCN, but they “are quite widespread and safe in India in terms of conservation, although they are under some pressure from trade for their gallbladders,” says Ullas Karanth , director of the Wildlife Conservation Society’s India program. The bears are also abundant in many reserves in India, he adds, “where they are especially adapted to eating termites—and fond of honey.”

Shere Khan
Mowgli’s jungle foe, the Bengal tiger Shere Khan, is the most imperiled of Kipling’s characters. According to new estimates , about 3,890 tigers remain in the wild worldwide—about half of which live in India. That’s an apparent increase from 2010, when 3,200 tigers were thought to exist. But not everyone is convinced that the bump truly represents a recovery for the big cats, and new data published by the IUCN shows that global tiger range has declined by 40 percent since 2010.
“A lot of people hailed this as a huge success in tiger conservation,” says Rabinowitz. “In reality, it was a huge success in assessing tiger numbers.” He credit",Panther; Panther athletics; Panthers; The Panthers; Panther (disambiguation); Panther,Leopard,A black leopard.,0,0

qb_113,The Khyber Pass is approximately how many miles long?,"ancientworldstudies / khyber pass
   
 
     The Khyber pass is a mountain pass that  links Pakistan and Afghanistan. It is 33 miles long and reaches around 3,500 feet in elevation. At its widest point it is about 450 feet and at its narrowest point it is only 10 feet wide. For hundreds of years the Khyber pass has been a very important trade rout between south Asia and central Asia.
    Some historians believe that the Indo-Aryans used the Khyber pass to migrate into India around 1500 BCE which would make them the first major group to use the pass. Also in the 6th century BCE. Darius the Great brought Persians through the Khyber pass to expand the Archeamenian Empire to India. Later Alexander the great took his army through the pass to India.  there have been many different groups of people that have used the Khyber pass during their conquests.
      Currently the Khyber pass is home to the Pathans, a group of Pushtu-speaking tribes. The Pathans are a very traditional group, and they are very skilled fighters. A lot of the Taliban fighters of Afghanistan came from the Khyber pass area.
     When the British invaded India the Pathans guarded the Khyber pass because the British were trying to gain controle of the pass. They fought three Afghan wars from 1830-42 1878-90 and 1919. Even though the British won the war the British and the Indian troops suffered double the amount of casualties that the Afghans had. So the result it arguable.
     Currently the Khyber Pass has two highways going through it. They connect peshawar with Kabul. One of the highways is used for traditional caravan. While the other is used for modern motorized vehicles. The Khyber pass will continue to be a dangerous but important route from Afghanistan to India.

Khyber Pass, Khyber also spelled Khaybar, orKhaibar,  most northerly and important of the passes between Afghanistan and Pakistan . The pass connects Kābul with Peshāwar . The pass has historically been the gateway for invasions of the Indian subcontinent from the northwest. The name Khyber is also applied to the range of arid, broken hills through which the pass runs and which form the last spurs of the Spin Ghar (Safīd Kūh) Range. On either side of the connecting ridge are the sources of two small streams, the beds of which form the Khyber gorge. This narrow gorge forms the Khyber Pass; it winds between cliffs of shale and limestone, 600–1,000 feet (180–300 m) high, and enters the Khyber Hills from the Shadi Bagiār opening, a few miles beyond Jamrūd , Pak., and continues northwestward for about 33 miles (53 km). Just beyond the old Afghan fort of Haft Chāh, it opens onto the barren Lowyah Dakkah plain, which stretches to the Kābul River .

After a steep ascent at its southern entrance, the pass rises gradually to Fort Ali Masjid (3,174 feet), where the Khyber River (Khyber Khwār) leaves the pass to the south. For 5 miles from Ali Masjid the pass becomes a defile not more than 600 feet wide, flanked by imposing and precipitous walls. From Zīntara village on northward, the pass becomes a valley a mile or more wide, with forts, villages, and scattered cultivation plots. About 10 miles west of Ali Masjid lies Landi Kotal fort and cantonment (3,518 feet); this is the highest point in the pass and is also an important market centre with an alternate route back to Peshāwar. There the summit widens out northward for 2 miles. The main pass, however, descends from Landi Kotal through Shinwārī territory to Landi Khāna, where it runs through another gorge and enters Afghanistan territory at Towr Kham (Torkham; 2,300 feet), winding another 10 miles down the valley to Lowyah Dakkah.

qb_162,Which Asian country hosted its first Formula One Grand Prix motor race in October 2010?,"2010 FORMULA 1 KOREAN GRAND PRIX
HAILED A SUCCESS
October 24, 2010, Seoul, Korea – South Korea’s introduction to the world of Formula 1 was nothing short of spectacular, with just about every element of what has made this the pinnacle of the sport contained in 55 laps of non-stop drama.
Despite the inclement weather, more than 80,000 spectators turned out for the 2010 FORMULA 1 KOREAN GRAND PRIX, proving motorsport has now truly arrived in South Korea.  The event was hailed... as a resounding success, with Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso storming to victory in the nation’s inaugural Grand Prix.
Promoters, the Korean Auto Valley Operation (KAVO), which also developed the region’s – and the world’s – newest state-of-the-art motorsport facility, believe hosting the Grand Prix has been the perfect start to their plans to develop the sport in the country.
Said KAVO Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Korea Automobile Association (KARA), Mr. Yung Cho Chung: “We are delighted at the success of the 2010 FORMULA 1 KOREAN GRAND PRIX, and the enormous, enthusiastic crowd has proved the sport already has a strong fan base here.  We have overcome several challenges over the last few months, but our work is just beginning.  The KIC is an important new facility for regional and international competition, but also one from which we will both develop the sport from the grass roots, and build a motorsport business and tourism hub.”
Next up for the KIC is the international Korea Formula 3 Superprix, to be held from November 26-28.  The world’s leading Formula 3 drivers, all of whom have their sights fixed on a future seat in Formula 1, will arrive in Korea straight from the Macau Grand Prix.  The event will be the season-closer for Formula 3, and represents a final opportunity for the leading drivers from the various championships to compete with each other in an end-of-season grand finale.
Said Mr. Chung: “The KIC will continue to host international, regional and domestic events year-round.  It’s fantastic for us and for the fans to open the facility with a round of the FIA Formula 1 World Championship, and then to follow just a month later with a prestigious international junior single seater shoot-out.”
The Korea International Circuit is designed as a dual structure: the 5.615km Formula 1 track, which will include elements of a street circuit and has one of the longest straights of any track, and a shorter, permanent circuit of 3.045km.
The state-of-the-art motorsport facility is the country’s first motorsport to meet Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA) Grade 1 standards.
The track was designed by the world-renowned Hermann Tilke, and incorporates local elements such as the roof of the main grandstand which resembles the eaves of traditional Korean ‘hanok’ houses.  A total of 170,000 spectators are accommodated at the circuit, with 16,000 seats in the main grandstand.

Introduction
""The loveliest fleet of islands that lies anchored in any ocean."" --Mark Twain
Few would quarrel with Mark Twain's vivid description of Hawaii, written after his 4-month stay in 1866.  The Hawaiian Islands were discovered and settled around the 6th century A.D. by Polynesians sailing  from islands, probably the Marquesas, in the southern tropical Pacific.  Subsequently, a thousand years or more of cultural isolation passed before Hawaii was first visited  by non-Polynesians. On January 18, 1778, during his third major voyage in the Pacific, the famous  British navigator and explorer, Captain James Cook, sighted the Polynesians' secluded home.
Cook named his discovery the ""Sandwich Islands,"" in honor of the Earl of Sandwich, then  First Lord of the British Admiralty. Mark Twain's fleet of islands is larger than Rhode Island  and Connecticut combined. The island of Hawaii, commonly called the ""Big Island,"" covers more  than twice the total area of the other islands.
Hawaii, which became our 50th state in 1959, is now home for more than one million people and hosts many times that number of visitors each year.
The principal Hawaiian islands  (all capital letters) are the exposed tops of volcanoes that rise tens of thousands of feet above the ocean floor.   Some islands are made up of two or more volcanoes. Loihi Seamount, Hawaii's newest volcano, still lies    about 3,100 feet beneath the sea.

Before they meet, in the days when South Africa still had apartheid, newspaper editor Donald Woods and political activist Steve Biko are on opposite sides of the fence. Woods is critical of Biko, but will soon change his mind - when he realises all Biko wants is justice for the oppressed majority of South Africans. When Biko is killed in police custody, Woods is determined to honour his fallen friend by getting the truth out to the world even if it means putting his own life at risk.

Birds, Mammals and Reptiles Sorted Alphabetically
This very long alphabetical list of creatures is helpful for making checklists. But a list sorted by genus is more helpful for researching species. See our Bird List sorted by scientific name .
The following list is an actual list created by Amazon Nature Tours on one of our tours. Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of creatures found in the Amazon, but rather a record of the creatures we observed. The trip took place in the State of Amazonas, Brasil with some species observed  also in the States of Para and Matto Grosso do Sul. Appended to the bird list are brief Mammal and  Reptile lists.

What Insects Does the Cardinal Eat?
Hatchlings eat mostly invertebrates while adult birds have a more varied diet.
Jupiterimages/Photos.com/Getty Images
The family Cardinalidae contains 11 genera and 42 species, which are commonly divided into cardinals, tanagers, grosbeaks and buntings. Their habitats range from North to South America. Some are migratory and others are not. Cardinals eat a varied diet of seeds, plants, berries and invertebrates -- the proportion of each varies between species.
Nonmigratory Cardinals
Migratory cardinals are more likely to eat different foods at different times of year, based on their location. Nonmigratory cardinals, like the northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), are limited to the food sources at their year-round location. Northern cardinals are typically fruit and seed eaters, but about 30 percent of their diet is made up of insects. They eat beetles, crickets, katydids, leafhoppers, cicadas, flies, centipedes, spiders and butterflies when these creatures are active. Cardinals are considered helpful to farmers because they also eat codling moths, cotton cutworms, scale insects, cotton bollworms, grasshoppers, aphids, snails and slugs, all of which are considered pest bugs. Cardinalis sinuatus, or pyrrhuloxia, is another crested, nonmigratory cardinal that eats insects such as grasshoppers, caterpillars, beetles, stinkbugs and cicadas.
Bug Hunters
Depending on the species, cardinals will eat primarily either invertebrates or plants, seeds and fruit. Many of the tanagers (genus Piranga) rely mostly on insects and other bugs for sustenance. The scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea) eats a wide variety of invertebrates, including ants, sawflies, moths, butterflies, beetles, flies, cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, plant lice, scale insects, termites, grasshoppers, locusts, dragonflies, dobsonflies, snails, earthworms and spiders. The indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) eats lots of invertebrates during the summer migration, such as spiders, caterpillars, grasshoppers, aphids, cicadas, canker worms, click beetles and weevils. These plucky little birds can even eat the brown-tail moth caterpillar, whose nasty fuzz can cause serious allergic reactions in people.
Occasional Insect Eaters
Some cardinals only eat large amounts of invertebrates during spring, the breeding season. The rose-breasted grosbeak (Pheucticus ludovicianus) is a migratory cardinal that lives in Canada, migrates through the United States and winters in Central and South America. When migrating, these birds live primarily on berries. During the breeding season they eat mostly insects like beetles, bees, ants, sawflies, bugs, butterflies and moths. The painted bunting (Passerina ciris) eats seeds and berries most of the year, but during mating season bulks up on protein-rich bugs like grasshoppers, weevils, other beetles, caterpillars, spiders, snails, wasps and flies.
Hunting Styles
Different cardinal types will look for food in different ways. Piranga olivacea, or the scarlet tanager, does most of its hunting in high branches and on tree trunks, rarely descending to the ground to look for food. Scarlet tanagers can hunt while hovering or in flight. These birds snuff larger prey by smashing it against a branch or tree trunk. Grubs and larvae they gobble down whole. Rose-breasted grosbeaks pick their food from dense foliage and branches and also snatch insects from the air mid-flight. Painted buntings are ground foragers, but in the breeding season they also search for food in marshes and trees up to 30 feet off the ground. Painted buntings have even been observed plucking bugs from or diving straight through webs to steal a spider's dinner. Northern cardinals forage on the ground and around shrubberies, but are willing to eat from hanging bird feeders.

Answer:
Tiffany and Co. has been in charge of making the Super Bowl trophy since 1967. The original design was sketched on a cocktail napkin during a lunch between Tiffany's then vice president Oscar Riedener and the NFL's then commissioner Pete Rozelle in New York City.
It takes four months and 72 hours for the trophy to be finished.
Engraved on the trophy are the words ""Vince Lombardi Trophy,"" the roman numerals corresponding to that year's Super Bowl, and the logo of the NFL. Details such as the winning team's name and score are engraved after the presentation of the trophy.

Transcript
EDWARD R. MURROW, ARCHIVAL FILM: Just thirty days ago, Fidel Castro entered Havana to be greeted by cheering mobs, as one of the greatest heroes in Cuba's history. Fidel Castro, at the age of 32, you now have in your hands a great deal of power and a great deal of responsibility. Aren't you a little frightened by this?
FIDEL CASTRO: Well really, not frightened, because I have self-confidence, but something worried, of course.
MURROW: Not frightened but a little worried.
FIDEL CASTRO: Yes.
NARRATOR: He had led a revolution that overthrew a hated dictator.  And on January 6, 1959, the day of his triumphant march into Havana, he embodied the hopes of an entire nation.
CARLOS ALBERTO MONTANER, AUTHOR (SPANISH): Fidel arrives as a messiah. Young, bearded, and at the head of a guerilla army. That unleashes the imagination and the fantasy of the Cuban people.
GEORGIE ANNE GEYER, JOURNALIST: You had this romantic revolutionary hero. He's big. He's manly. Very charismatic.
ARCHIVAL FILM: Fidel, will you say just a few words to New Yorkers who have seen you for the first time?
FIDEL CASTRO: Well, I am very glad to be here again, because I fulfilled my promise of coming after the victorious revolution.
GEYER: This is a man of huge appetites and huge ambition.
BRIAN LATELL, CIA ANALYST: He is endlessly complex. He is a man of enormous intellect, of an inflexible will. His revolution was from the very first moments a one-man show.
NARRATOR: He would rouse his people to accomplish heroic feats -- in the name of justice and the promise of a brilliant future. Send his soldiers to the farthest reaches of the world, inspiring many with dreams of greatness.
NORBERTO FUENTES, AUTHOR (SPANISH): There was a thirst for glory, for heroism and he awakened that thirst.
NARRATOR: But he would drive two million Cubans into exile and silence those who dared challenged his rule.
MARIFELI PEREZ STABLE, AUTHOR: The extraordinary leadership that Castro exercised went along with thousands of people brought before firing squads. Forty, or maybe even fifty thousand political prisoners, the treatment of political prisoners.
ARCHIVAL FILM -- FIDEL CASTRO (SPANISH): Only now I understand that my destiny was not to rest at the end of my life.
NARRATOR: For more than four decades Fidel Castro has ruled Cuba. He survived a U.S. backed invasion. Countless assassination plots. An economic embargo. Even the collapse of his benefactor, the Soviet Union.
JAMES BLIGHT, PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: The epic of the Castro era is probably one of the greatest stories of the last one hundred years. What are the odds that a little, dinky country would project its forces around the world and drive the United States crazy? Impossible. How could it happen?
NARRATOR: His classmates called him ""el guajiro,"" the hick, and he liked nothing more than to revisit the Cuba of his childhood. Fidel Castro came of age at Las Manacas, a sprawling sugar plantation in Cuba's remote northeast. His father, Angel, a former Spanish soldier, had come to Cuba at the turn of the century to fight in the Spanish-American War, and made his fortune growing sugarcane for the U.S.-owned United Fruit Company, a, the dominant economic and social force in the region at the time.
GEORGIE ANNE GEYER: There is definitely a lot of history encoded in that childhood of Fidel Castro's. He was the outsider. He was born illegitimately. His father had been married to a schoolteacher. Then he took up with the family maid, who was Fidel's mother. And they were only married when the children were sent to Catholic schools. Fidel very seldom spoke about this. Never directly.
NARRATOR: Fidel's mother, Lina Ruz, was a poor but ambitious country girl. Once described as an ""Annie Oakley"" type she was known to fire a gun to call her family to dinner. Though Lina barely knew how to read and write, she insisted their children get the best education Angel's money could buy. Fidel and his two brothers, Raúl and Ramón, were sent to a boarding school in Santiago de Cuba. But the unruly Castro boys were too disruptive and were expelled.
BRIAN LATELL: Fidel told his father and mother, ""I want to go back to that school."" But his parents said, ""No you can't go back, you and your brothers were just too rough, you were too violent, and the priests don't want you there anymore."" And, uh, what he did was he told his mother, ""If you do not send me back to that school I will burn this house down."" And his mother knew that this boy, this ferocious son of hers, truly meant what he said.
NARRATOR: In October 1941, at age fifteen, Fidel went to Havana, to attend El Colegio de Belén, Cuba's best and most exclusive school. His rural upbringing clashed with that of his schoolmates, raised in the cultured and literate homes of Cuba's upper class. His reckless behavior earned him a nickname: ""El Loco,"" the crazy one.

The Revolution and Social Change
Libya Table of Contents
In their September 1969 revolution, Qadhafi and the young officers who provided most of his support aimed with idealistic fervor at bringing to an end the social inequities that had marked both the colonial periods and the monarchical regime. The new government that resulted was socialist, but Qadhafi stressed that it was to be a kind of socialism inspired by the humanitarian values inherent in Islam. It called for equitable distribution to reduce disparities between classes in a peaceful and affluent society, but in no sense was it to be a stage on the road to communism.
On the eve of the 1969 revolution, the royal family and its most eminent supporters and officeholders, drawn from a restricted circle of wealthy and influential families, dominated Libyan society. These constituted what may be termed the traditional sociopolitical establishment, which rested on patronage, clientage, and dependency. Beneath this top echelon was a small middle class. The Libyan middle class had always been quite small, but it had expanded significantly under the impact of oil wealth. In the mid- l960s, it consisted of several distinct social groupings: salaried religious leaders and bureaucrats, old families engaged in importing and contracting, entrepreneurs in the oil business, shopkeepers, self-employed merchants and artisans and prosperous farmers and beduin. Workers in small industrial workshops, agricultural laborers, and peasant farmers, among others, composed the lower class.
Most of the urban population consisted of the families of first-generation workers, small shopkeepers, and a horde of public workers. Above them were thin layers of the newly rich and of old, prosperous families. An urban working class, however, had largely failed to develop, and the middle class was a feeble one that in no way resembled the counterpart element that had become a vital political force in many other countries of the Arab world.
At the top of the rural social structure, the shaykhs of the major tribes ruled on the basis of inherited status. In the cities, corresponding roles were played by the heads of the wealthy families and by religious figures. These leaders were jealous of their position and, far from concerning themselves with furthering social progress, saw modernization as a threat. In no way, however, did the leaders present a united front.
The development of the petroleum industry was accompanied by profound technical and organizational changes and by the appearance of a younger elite whose outlook had been greatly affected by technological advances: among their number were technocrats, students, and young army officers. Not the least notable of the factors that set this new element apart was age. The civilians of this group, as well as the military officers, were for the most part in their thirties or younger, and their views had little in common with those of the aging authorities who had long controlled a swollen bureaucracy (11 percent of the 1969 labor force). More urbanized and better educated than their elders, this new group entertained hopes and aspirations that had been frustrated by the group surrounding King Idris. In particular, resentment had been aroused by the arbitrariness, corruption, and inefficiency of Idris' government as well as by its questionable probity in the distribution of oil-funded revenues.
The young officers who formed the Free Officers Movement and its political nucleus, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), showed a great deal of dedication to the revolutionary cause and a high degree of uniformity in political and economic outlook. In Libya, as in a number of other Arab countries, admission to the military academy and careers as army officers were options available to members of the less privileged economic strata only after national independence was attained. A military career, offering new opportunities for higher education and upward economic and social mobility, was thus a greater attraction for young men from poorer families than for those of the wealthy and the traditional elite. These youthful revolutionaries came from quite modest social backgrounds, representing the oases and the interior as opposed to the coastal cities, and the minor suppressed tribes as opposed to the major aristocratic ones.
The officers of the RCC--all captains and lieutenants-- represented the forefront of a social revolution that saw the middle and lower middle classes assert control over social and political prerogatives heretofore denied them. They quickly displaced the former elite of the Idris era and became themselves the prime movers of the Libyan state. Numbering only about a dozen men, they were gradually joined by sympathetic civilian and military personnel in constituting a new elite.

Cheap Night In: Come Dine WIth Me
Sick of boozing out after the Christmas binge? Fancy unleashing your inner culinary genius? Create your own version of the hit TV show...
Nicky Branagh
- 08 June 2011
You've probably heard of TV's  Come Dine With Me. In fact, you might have sat through one of More 4's Come Dine With Me Sunday marathon's - if only so you can hear Dave Lamb's genius commentary.
Instead of sitting and watching the programme however, you  could host your very own  Come Dine With Me series, taking it in turns with your friends to cook for each other and - more importantly - judge (we really mean criticise) one another on your culinary skills... What better way to kick off this blustery new year?
Step 1. Planning
Get into a group of four or more and work out when you are all going to cook. You could do it a la the TV programme and fill a week with three course meals but, let's face it - the likelihood of you all having a whole, evening-free week is pretty slim.
Work out how many of you will be on each team. If you're all confident in the kitchen, you could fly solo but it's probably more fun if you double up or even team up as house. But then, too many cooks, of course, spoil the broth. And anyway, who has that many plates to go round?!
Decide on a set menu. You might want to swap the starter for a cocktail, for example, or scrap dessert altogether. Once you've agreed, set a realistic budget that you all have to stick to. We're fair people, us Beaners.
Step 2. Invites
If you're first up, impress your mates with some invites, detailing your menu. You could also set the bar (read: get extra points) by coming up with an overall theme, indicated by your invites. How far you then go with it is up to you! Here are some tried and tested theme ideas to get you started:
Mexican.
Alice in Wonderland.
Step 3. Food
If you've come up with a theme, then you might already know what sort of food you're going to cook. Plan ahead, shop to your budget and, if you've got the time and patience, do a little practice run. Definitely advised if you're doing this on your own. Trust us!
Don't have the kitchen equipment you need? Get these fancy knives for less than two quid - you'll look like a right pro.
Step 4. Entertainment
Now this is the tricky part. You could always skip the entertainment part - after all, the night's going to be eventful enough. An overall theme however, might make it easier to decide what you could do, entertainment wise. For example:
Mexican theme: Pinata. Asda have a donkey one for around a fiver.
MoTown theme: karaoke.
Alice in Wonderland Theme: Er, OK, we're stumped. flamingo croquet , anyone?
Step 5. Scoring
A  Come Dine With Me night would not be complete without scoring. While it might be difficult to organise for a camera crew to sit in the back of a black cab while you drive around the block, talking to the camera while - most probably - off your face, you can always use that slightly less glamourous alternative: pen and paper.
Mix things up a bit by giving a different score for each part of the menu and add a 'comments' section at the bottom. Put all the scores into one envelope and nominate someone to keep it safe. No peeking!
Alternatively, if you've got a swanky smart phone, you could video yourself and note your scores that way. Just make sure you don't delete/let you friends swipe your phone/accidentally upload to Facebook.

It's been more than 20 years since the show started and until today, all of the episodes and everything in it makes me laugh hard.
Not much dialogue here, but the unusual acts of Mr. Bean, from facial expressions to blowing up a laboratory, to losing his shorts in the swimming pool, they really give the purpose for this show. Rowan Atkinson has done a feat that no one else could ever manage.
It may have ended many years back (except for the 2007 movie), but for many years to come, Mr. Bean will be one of the most remarkable shows ever to exist.

Mr. Bean is an all time classic TV show. This series from the United Kingdom stars the incredibly talented Rowan Atkinson (also of Black Adder fame) as Mr. Bean, a usually silent, awkward English man who goes through his day to day life creating huge problems for himself and those around him. The show featured a lot of physical comedy from Atkinson and no one else could ever play this character. All of the episodes are classics but my faves are the one where he decides to go diving, the one where he gets a goldfish at the fair, and the one where he celebrates his own birthday.

This is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen! Mr. Bean is a kid in a grown ups body. He tries alot of unusual things that would get him or others into bad situations. He tries things that wouldn't embarrass him or make him seem weird. But in the end Mr. Bean didn't have to do all the hard work he did because he finds out something else like for example a guy was blind or Mr. Bean was looking at the wrong test. Mr. Bean wants things to be his own way. While trying to accomplish what he is trying to do, he gets himself or someone else into more trouble! Well basicly it's AWSOME!

Mr. Bean is a silly and crazy man who lives in an apartment with his Teddy Bear. He makes stupid things such as losing his swimsuit in a swimming pool, or cheating during a test.

I love it! It's what makes people laught of 90s jokes. Mr. Bean is the best live-action series of the 20th century. And people can't think the show died in 1995, it returned as a movie in 2007. The show is better than the animated series, in this one you get Mr Bean's facial expressions, and characters are not the same (I mean the animated series has got the robbers in a lot of episodes). It's incredible how you can laught of a dumb dumb! And pisodes as one episodes are good because you have surprises when another mini-episode is shown (if you didn't watch it) So that's what I think of this british idiot.

Mr. Bean is a wonderful show and a testament to the magic of physical comedy. Given Rowan Atkinson's remarkably verbal agility as displayed in the Blackadder series, what an amazingly versatily actor he is to play the near silent Mr. Bean.
Mr. Bean is a bizarre man-child and most episodes revolve around him trying to accomplish some simple, everyday task. He is dumb and greedy, but mostly good-natured. It's really quite hard to describe what is so funny about Mr. Bean. Bean has an astonishingly rubbery face and limbs that are just entertaining to watch. A simple act like him crinkling is nose is, somehow, funny.
As stated, the plots of Mr. Bean are exceedingly simple. The settings are non-descript, although the Britishness gives it a slight exotic flavor for Americans.
The indelible image burned in my mind from watching Mr. Bean is when he falls asleep in church. His limbs became these wobbl spaghetti strangs. It was riveting, like watching a tightrope walker risking death -- but all he was doing was standing there.
In many ways, Mr. Bean was a modern version of miming Miming is the most hated performance art, yet Atkinson made it hysterically funny with Mr. Bean. Just remarkable.

Rowan is genious and so are the other producers of this show. I never managed to watch Mr Beans holiday yet so its pretty sad. I just love the way how Bean acts in those kinda situations.

BBC News
Read more about sharing.
Close share panel
Image caption Despite living in self-imposed exile, Mr Thaksin is still a dominant and divisive presence in Thai politics
Thaksin Shinawatra is one of the most influential - and polarising - characters in Thai politics.
The Supreme Court has stripped his family of $1.4bn (£910m) in contested assets, over allegations of corruption and conflict of interest, but he remains determined to play a leading role in Thailand.
A telecommunications billionaire, Mr Thaksin was the first prime minister in Thailand's history to lead an elected government through a full term in office.
He was enormously popular, especially among the rural poor, but also proved a divisive figure and was deeply unpopular among many of Bangkok's rich elite.
After more than five years in power, he was ousted in a military coup in September 2006, accused of corruption and abuse of power.
He has been in self-imposed exile since - mostly in London or Dubai.
He faces a two-year jail sentence if he returns to Thailand, after being convicted in absentia on a conflict-of-interest charge.
Former policeman
But even though he is out of the country, he still effectively controls the main opposition Pheu Thai party, which his younger sister, Yingluck, is leading into a general election on 3 July.
Born in 1949 in the northern city of Chiang Mai, Mr Thaksin started his career as a police officer.
In 1973, he received a government scholarship to study for a masters degree in criminal justice in the United States.
When he returned he went into business, and during the late 1980s began building a successful telecommunications empire.
He founded the Thai Rak Thai (Thais Love Thais) party in 1998, and its rapid emergence transformed the country's politics.
Mr Thaksin swept into office in 2001, soundly defeating the old guard from the Democrat Party.
Poorer voters liked his offers of cheap medical care and debt relief, his nationalist platform and his contempt for the ""Bangkok elite"".
But big business also liked him for his CEO-style of government and his ""Thaksinomics"" policies, which created a new boom in a country where the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s had begun.
Mr Thaksin also won support for his handling of the tsunami relief effort after the 2004 Indian Ocean disaster, which devastated parts of south-western Thailand.
Other things were not so easy. He had to face the fallout from his government's suppression of news of an outbreak of bird flu, as well as criticism over the violent deaths of more than 2,500 people during a crackdown on drugs in 2003.
Thailand's Corruption Commission found he had failed to declare all of his wealth, and he was also criticised over the government's handling of the upsurge in violence in the largely Muslim south.
Yet each time he faced pressure, Mr Thaksin appeared to ride out the storm, his backing among his key supporters - Thailand's rural voters - apparently unscathed.
Political turmoil
It was his family's decision to sell its shares in one of Thailand's biggest telecom groups, Shin Corp, that led to Mr Thaksin's downfall.
Image caption Thaksin's younger sister is leading the main opposition party in upcoming elections
The sale, in early 2006, which netted his family and friends $1.9bn, angered many urban Thais, who complained that the Thaksin family had avoided paying tax and passed control of an important national asset to Singaporean investors.
Amid large-scale street demonstrations, Mr Thaksin called a snap general election for April 2006, effectively telling opponents to ""put up or shut up"".
But main opposition parties boycotted the polls and many voters chose to register a ""no vote"".
Faced with the threat of further protests, Mr Thaksin said he would step down. He did for a few weeks, but returned to office in May.
In September that year, following months of political uncertainty, the military seized power while the prime minister was out of the country.
Mr Thaksin relocated to the UK, but shortly after his allies won the first post-coup elections in late 2007, he returned to Thailand.
There he and his family faced a raft of corruption charges - allegations which the former Thai leader probably expected to come to nothing.
But the courts - greatly empowered by a new military-backed constitution - pursued the cases against him and his family with new vigour.
First his wife, Pojaman, and then Mr Thaksin himself were sentenced to jail terms - with the Supreme Court finding the former leader guilty of corruption.
His assets were frozen, forcing him to sell his controlling stake in English Premier League football club Manchester City shortly afterwards.
Mr Thaksin left Thailand, failing to return home for a court appearance from the Olympic Games in Beijing in August 2008, and became a fugitive.
Since divorcing his wife - who now lives in Bangkok after her sentence was suspended - he has spent most of his time in Dubai.

My struggle with colors comes from an early age, when I found it difficult to play soccer at night, as I couldn't differentiate the player's uniform!
I still recall my first attempt to get my driver's license. At that time, the tester used to a pull a lever in a traffic light, while the candidate had to tell the color shown.
Obviously, my first attempt was a complete failure. I even said ‘blue’ and ‘white’, forgetting there were just 3 colors at the traffic lights!
Well, I won’t get into details here. Suffice it to say that in my third attempt - 10 years later - I finally got the right to drive!
But that's another story... ;-)

qb_1912,"On a standard dartboard, which number lies opposite number 4?","The Dartboard Sequence
The Dartboard Sequence
The arrangement of the numbers around the circumference of a standard  dart board is as shown below         20 1 18 4 13 6 10 15 2 17 3 19 7 16 8 11 14 9 12 5   Oddly enough, no one seems to know for sure how this particular arrangement was selected.  It evidently dates back at least 100 years.  Some say the  pattern was devised by a carpenter named Brian Gamlin in 1896, while others attribute it to someone named Thomas William Buckle in 1913, but both of  these attributions are relatively recent, and neither can be traced back  to a contemporary source.  Also, although it's clear that the numbers are ordered to mix the large and small together, and possibly to separate numerically close values as far as possible (e.g., 20 is far from 19), no  one seems to know of any simple criterion that uniquely singles out this  particular arrangement as the best possible in any quantitative sense.   It may be just an accident of history that this particular arrangement  has been adopted as the standard dart board format.   It's interesting to consider various possible criteria for choosing a  circular arrangement of the first n positive integers.  In order to get  as ""flat"" a distribution as possible, we might try to minimize the  sum of the squares of each k consecutive terms.  For example, setting  k = 3, the standard dard board sequence gives    (20+1+18)^2 + (1+18+4)^2 + (18+4+13)^2 + ... + (5+20+1)^2  =  20478   Apparently the standard board layout described above is called the ""London"" dart board, and there is another, less common, version called the ""Manchester"" dart board, which has the sequence        20 1 16 6 17 8 12 9 14 5 19 2 15 3 18 7 11 10 13 4  for which the sum of squares of each set of three consecutive numbers is 20454, just slightly less than the London arrangement.  In contrast,  if we were to arrange the numbers by just inter-weaving the largest and  smallest numbers like this          20 1 19 2 18 3 17 4 16 5 15 6 14 7 13 8 12 9 11 10     the resulting sum of squares of each 3 consecutive elements is 20510, so the standard dart boards are, in this sense, more flat distributions.   Needless to say, all of these arrangements are much more flat than the  natural monotonic sequence         1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20   which has a sum of 24350.    By the way, note that if the sum of the squares of every sum of three  consecutive numbers for a given arrangement is S, then we can form another arrangement with the same sum simply by taking the ""21-complement"", i.e.,  subtracting each number from 21. For example, the complement of the  standard London arrangement is        1 20 3 17 8 15 11 6 19 4 18 2 14 5 13 10 7 12 9 16  which has the same sum (20478) as the London arrangement. This works because if we begin with an arrangement a,b,c,d,... having the sum     S = (a+b+c)^2 + (b+c+d)^2 + (c+d+e)^2 + ...  and replace each of the numbers a,b,c,... with 21-a, 21-b, 21-c,... respectively, the sum S' of this complementary arrangement is     S' = [(21-a)+(21-b)+(21-c)]^2 + [(21-b)+(21-c)+(21-d)]^2 + ...        = [63-(a+b+c)]^2 + [63-(b+c+d)]^2 + ...        = S + 20(63)^2 - 2(63)[(a+b+c)+(b+c+d)+...]  Each of the numbers from 1 to 20 appears three times in the summation inside the square brackets in the last term, so that summation equals 630, and hence S' = S. (The same identity applies to the N+1 complement for sums of squares of every sum of k consecutive terms of a circular  arrangement of the first N integers.)  How would we go about finding the circular arrangement of the integers  1 to 20 that gives the smallest sum of squares of every sum of three  consecutive numbers?  One possible approach would be to begin with the  monotonic arrangement and then check each possible transposition of two numbers to see which one gives the lowest result. Then make that change  and repeat the process, at each stage always choosing the transposition  that gives the steepest reduction in the sum.  This ""greedy algorithm""  produces arrangements with the following sums (of squares of each 3  consecutive terms around the cycle):    24350  21650  20678  20454  20230  20110  19990  19970               19950  19946  19938  19936  19930  19926  19918  Once it reaches the arrangement with the sum 19918, no further  transposition of two numbers gives any reduction in the sum.  Of course, this doesn't imply that 19918 is the minimum possible sum, it simply means that it is a ""local"" minimum.  We might try to make our search algorithm more robust by considering all possible permutations of THREE numbers at each stage.  (This includes permutations of two, since some of the permutations of three numbers leave one of the numbers fixed.)  Applying the greedy algorithm to permutations of any three numbers gives dartboard arrangements with the sums     24350  21542  20362  20098  19978  19954  19942  19930  Once we reach 19930, no further permutation of three numbers g",16; sixteen; 16,13,15,0,0

All The Tropes Wiki
File:MASH.jpg
One of the most commercially and critically successful series in television history, M*A*S*H ( short for Mobile Army Surgical Hospital , a type of Army field hospital first activated in the last month of World War II ) is, to quote its lead character Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda), ""Finest kind.""
The show ran on CBS from 1972 to 1983 , seven years longer than The Korean War during which it takes place. At first seen as a wacky, slightly edgy sitcom based on Robert Altman's 1970 movie , the series moved away from strictly comedic storylines early in its run (Season 1's ""Sometimes You Hear the Bullet"" was the first Tear Jerker ), and began to incorporate dramatic plotlines in conjunction with comedic ones in the same episode.
""Abyssinia, Henry"" was the final episode of the third season, and is seen as a turning point for the series. It was the final episode for both Henry Blake (McLean Stevenson) and ""Trapper"" John McIntyre (Wayne Rogers), and its tragic ending (Henry's plane home is shot down; ""there were no survivors"") delineated the line between ""Funny M*A*S*H"" and ""Dramatic M*A*S*H,"" as many fans would later divide the series. The fourth season was crucial to its success -- very few series, ensemble or otherwise, had ever lost such significant characters and kept its audience. The creators' decision to replace Henry and Trapper with completely different character types in Colonel Potter (Harry Morgan) and BJ Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell) succeeded, and the show built on its high Ratings .
In the ""Dramatic M*A*S*H"" phase, character development was key, and even one-note characters such as ""Hot Lips"" Houlihan (Loretta Swit) became more sympathetic and complex (as seen in Season 5's ""The Nurses,"" in which she asked her nurses, ""When did one of you ever even offer me a lousy cup of coffee?""). This shift probably led to Frank Burns (Larry Linville) getting a psychiatric discharge, since he had been developed as an unlikeable character with no room for change (Larry Linville even stated dislike for the character being so unlikeable). He was replaced by Charles Emerson Winchester III (David Ogden Stiers), a snooty Blue Blood doctor who was by contrast a real asset to the staff and even eventually becomes a nicer guy in his own way .
Other ways in which the series changed how the Sitcom was perceived was by its use (or disuse) of the Laugh Track , commonly imposed by the networks if a studio audience was not going to be present at the episodes' filming. The show's creators grudgingly accepted the laugh track, but soon imposed rules on when it was not to be used (during any of the operating room scenes), and dropped it entirely in certain nontypical episodes. Eventually they abandoned it entirely. The laugh track was never used when the series was broadcast by the BBC in the UK. (The DVDs of the series offer the option to watch the shows with or without the laugh track intact.)
M*A*S*H revolutionized the use of camera movements and editing styles on television -- for example, in its use of long tracking shots moving with the action (usually of soldiers being moved from helicopter/bus/Jeep to the OR). Also, later in its run it experimented with unusual storylines married with different camera moves and screen devices.
The use of Boom Up and Over was new to television at the time. The use of this technique in sequences where camp announcements were shown from the 'perspective' of the loudspeaker was groundbreaking and memorable.
M*A*S*H was noted for doing Something Completely Different very well -- keeping the tone of the show consistent while experimenting with unusual storylines or storytelling techniques. ""Hawkeye"" is a 25-minute monologue by Alan Alda. In ""Point of View,"" the entire episode is literally seen through the eyes of a wounded soldier via POV Cam . ""Life Time"" is told in Real Time , with a clock in the corner ticking off the minutes as the doctors race to replace a soldier's crushed aorta. It also has the obligatory Fever Dream Episode , Clip Show and a (largely improvised) Documentary Episode told as a series of television interviews with the characters.
Its final episode -- ""Goodbye, Farewell and Amen"" (aired February 28, 1983) -- was, for twenty-five years, the highest-rated TV program in United States history, with a 60.2 rating (percent of households watching) and a 77 share (percent of households watching, of those watching some program at that time). It still holds that record for non-sports programming.
Considering that the original novel consisted mostly of young doctors boasting about how much sex they have and shows a truly awful degree of sexism [1] to produce such a long, successful and at times thoughtful series is a fine example of Pragmatic Adaptation , a very nice change in a world full of Adaptation Decay .

Read the Spanish version
Sculptures and paintings in Spain represent some of the most valued artistic expressions in the art world. Some of the world's most renowned artists are Spanish painters and Spanish sculptors have also left their mark on society. In fact, Spain has such a strong artistic tradition that Spanish art has become a leading attraction for tourism.
Some famous Spanish sculptors include Mariano Benlliure, Vasco de la Zarza, Juan Bautista Monegro, Alonso Berruguete and many more.
The origins of painting in Spain can be traced back to illuminate manuscripts and mural decorations.  During the 16th and 17th centuries, considered Spain's Golden Age, many famous Spanish painters emerged including artists like Diego Velazquez, El Greco, Francisco Ribera and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo while Francisco de Goya dominated Spanish painting in the 18th century.
Some of the most famous Spanish painters of the 20th century include Joan Miro, Juan Gris, Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso. Picasso is considered to be the most innovative Spanish artists of the 20th century with famous masterpieces such as his Guernica painting. Picasso's work along with those of other famous Spanish painters are highly regarded and valued by important art galleries around the world.
Las Meninas (The Maids of Honor) by Diego Velazquez, is one of the most important and most viewed Spanish paintings in the world.
There are many more important Spanish painters and Spanish sculptors that have left an impressive legacy in the art world. In this section, we hope that you can find more about Spanish artists and sculptors and learn about them.

The History of Painting
ART   HISTORY ON DEMAND > Introduction  and Overview  
The history of painting is a never-ending chain that began with the very first pictures ever made. Each style grows out of the styles that came before it. Every great artist adds to the accomplishments of earlier painters and influences later painters.
We can enjoy a painting for its beauty alone. Its lines, forms, colors, and composition (arrangement of parts) may appeal to our senses and linger in our memories. But enjoyment of art increases as we learn when and why and how it was created.
A painting always describes something. It may describe the artist's impression of a scene or person. It also describes the artist's feelings about the art of painting itself. Suppose, for example, the artist paints a picture of the birth of Venus, the Roman goddess of love—a subject that has been used many times. The viewer may not learn anything new about the subject from the more recent version that could not have been learned from the older one. Why, then, do painters bother to depict the same scene again? The answer is that they want to tell us something new about the way the scene can be painted. In a way, the artist is saying, ""I have painted the birth of Venus as no other artist before me has painted it."" The artist not only depicts the birth of Venus but also makes a statement about the art of painting itself.
Many factors have influenced the history of painting. Geography, religion, national characteristics, historic events, the development of new materials—all help to shape the artist's vision. Throughout history, painting has mirrored the changing world and our ideas about it. In turn, artists have provided some of the best records of the development of civilization, sometimes revealing more than the written word.
Prehistoric Painting
Cave dwellers were the earliest artists. Colored drawings of animals, dating from about 30,000 to 10,000 B.C., have been found on the walls of caves in southern France and in Spain. Many of these drawings are amazingly well preserved because the caves were sealed up for many centuries. Early people drew the wild animals that they saw all around them. Very crude human figures, drawn in lifelike positions, have been found in Africa and eastern Spain.
The cave artists filled the cave walls with drawings in rich, bright colors. Some of the most beautiful paintings are in the Cave of Altamira, in Spain. One detail shows a wounded bison, no longer able to stand—probably the victim of a hunter. It is painted in reddish brown and outlined simply but skillfully in black. The pigments used by cave painters were earth ochers (iron oxides varying in color from light yellow to deep orange) and manganese (a metallic element). These were crushed into a fine powder, mixed with grease (perhaps animal fat), and put on with some sort of brush. Sometimes the pigments were used in sticks, like crayons. The grease mixed with the powdered pigments made the paint fluid and the pigment particles stick together. The cave dwellers must have made brushes out of animal hairs or plants, and sharp tools out of flint for drawing and scratching lines.
As far back as 30,000 years ago, people had invented the basic ","Francisco Goya; Francisco José Goya y Lucientes; Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes; José Luján; Francisco Jose de Goya; Francisco Goya Y Lucientes; Goya (artist); Franciso de Goya; Francisco José de Goya; De Goya; Goya y Lucientes; Goya y Lucientes, Francisco José de; Francisco De Goya; Francisco Jose De Goya Y Lucientes; Francisco de Goya; Francisco de Goya y Lucientes; Francesco José de Goya y Lucientes; Goya y Lucientes, Francisco Jose de; Fransisco Goya; Jose Lujan; Francisco Goya; Goya; Francesco Jose de Goya y Lucientes; Francisco Jose Goya y Lucientes; Francisco Goya y Lucientes; Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes; Francisco goya",Francisco Goya,Francisco de Goya.,1,1
