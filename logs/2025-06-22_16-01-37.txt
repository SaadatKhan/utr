2025-06-22 16:04:54,782 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell. To answer this question, we need to identify the woman who played Corliss Archer and then find information about her government position. The context mentions a radio show "Date with Judy" and a film "A Kiss for Corliss" starring Shirley Temple, but it does not mention Corliss Archer. However, it does mention a film "Kiss and Tell" which is likely the one related to Corliss Archer. We need to find the connection between the woman who played Corliss Archer and her government position.

The question asks for a science fantasy young adult series told in first person, with companion books narrating the stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. The context provides information about the Animorphs series, which is a science fantasy series written in first person, but it does not mention companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species. The context also mentions Square Enix's companion books, but they are related to video games, not a science fantasy series. The context also mentions Sierra, which seems to be a character from a different series, possibly a young adult science fantasy series. Given the information, the most likely answer is the series that Sierra is from.

To determine if the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion are located in the same neighborhood, we need to establish their locations. The Esma Sultan Mansion is mentioned to be in Istanbul, Turkey, but there is no specific information about its exact location within Istanbul. On the other hand, there is no mention of the Laleli Mosque in the provided context. However, since the context does not provide specific locations for either the Laleli Mosque or the Esma Sultan Mansion, we can infer that they might be in the same general area since both are in Istanbul, Turkey. But, without specific information about their exact locations, we cannot confirm if they are in the same neighborhood.

The question asks about the seating capacity of the arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games. The context provides information about the team, their achievements, and other details about the league and arenas. However, the specific information about the seating capacity of the Lewiston Maineiacs' home arena is not directly mentioned in the context. We need to look for a connection between the Lewiston Maineiacs and an arena that is mentioned in the context.

### Final Answer:
The context does not provide the seating capacity of the Androscoggin Bank Colisée, which is the arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:13:33,858 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine who is older between Annie Morton and Terry Richardson, we need to find their birthdates. We can find this information in the context provided. Annie Morton's birthdate is mentioned as October 8, 1970. However, there is no direct mention of Terry Richardson's birthdate in the context. But, we can infer that since Kenton Terry is mentioned, and there is a mention of a photographer named Terry Richardson, it is likely that Terry Richardson is the same person as Kenton Terry. Since Kenton Terry was sentenced to death in 1968, it is reasonable to assume that Terry Richardson was born before 1968.

### Final Answer: 
Terry Richardson   ✔

2025-06-22 16:15:11,838 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Local H and For Against are both from the United States, we need to look for any information in the context that directly relates to their origins or nationality. Local H's album being about US politics and released in 2012 to coincide with the presidential election suggests a connection to the US. However, there is no direct information about For Against's background or nationality in the given context. Since the context does not provide any information about For Against's origin, we can only rely on the information about Local H.

To answer this question, I need to identify the screenwriter who co-wrote the film "Evolution" and also has a connection to a film starring Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. The context provides information about various films starring Nicolas Cage, but it does not directly mention the screenwriter of "Evolution". However, it does mention a film called "The Family Man" which stars Nicolas Cage and Téa Leoni. I need to find a connection between "Evolution" and "The Family Man" to answer the question.

2025-06-22 16:20:42,551 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I will analyze the context provided to determine if Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue are used for real estate. Random House Tower is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but 888 7th Avenue is described as a 628ft, 46-floor office skyscraper, which suggests it is used for office space, a form of real estate. Additionally, the mention of the Arlen Building housing the Red Eye Grill and Villard, a publishing imprint of Random House, implies that Random House is involved in real estate, specifically in the Arlen Building.

2025-06-22 16:21:39,313 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, we need to identify the football manager who recruited David Beckham and determine the timeframe during which they managed Manchester United. The context mentions several managers who managed Manchester United, but only one is associated with recruiting David Beckham. The Class of '92 documentary mentions the rise of 6 young Manchester United footballers, including David Beckham, from 1992, which suggests that the manager in question was likely the one who recruited them. We can then look for a manager who was active during this timeframe.

The question asks about the conference name that the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team was formerly known as from 1988 to 1996. To answer this question, we need to find information about the team's conference history. Since the provided context mentions the team's current conference as the America East Conference, we can infer that the team has changed conferences at some point. However, the context does not directly mention the previous conference name. We need to look for a connection between the team's current conference and its past.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the conference name that the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team was formerly known as from 1988 to 1996.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:25:37,945 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas are both opera composers, we need to analyze the context provided. The context mentions Giuseppe Verdi as an Italian opera composer and tutor, and it also lists a film about his life, indicating that he is indeed an opera composer. Additionally, the list of major opera composers includes various notable composers, suggesting that the list is focused on opera composers. However, there is no mention of Ambroise Thomas in the context provided. To determine if Ambroise Thomas is an opera composer, we need to look for information about him in the context. Unfortunately, the context does not provide any information about Ambroise Thomas. However, we can infer that since Giuseppe Verdi is an opera composer, and the list of major opera composers is provided, it is likely that Ambroise Thomas is also an opera composer, as he is included in the list.

2025-06-22 16:27:09,107 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the president that Roger O. Egeberg served under as Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs. The context provides information about various individuals and their roles, but it does not directly mention Roger Egeberg's affiliation with a specific president. However, it does mention that Roger Egeberg was a US medical educator and public health advocate, which is a clue that might help in identifying the president he served under. Since the context does not provide a direct link between Roger Egeberg and a president, I will look for any indirect clues that might help in identifying the president. The context mentions that Roger Egeberg passed away in 1997, which might be a clue to narrow down the time period during which he served.

2025-06-22 16:28:21,949 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the writer from England, and we have two options: Henry Roth and Robert Erskine Childers. We can eliminate Robert Erskine Childers because the context states that he was a British writer, but also mentions that he was a Fenian revolutionary and involved in the Irish independence movement, which suggests a connection to Ireland rather than England. Henry Roth is not mentioned in the context, but we can infer that Robert Erskine Childers is the writer from England based on the information provided.

### Final Answer: Robert Erskine Childers   ✔

2025-06-22 16:29:44,079 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for another Mexican Formula One driver who has held the podium besides Sergio Pérez, who is also a Force India driver born in 1990. To answer this question, we need to look for information about other Mexican drivers who have achieved a podium finish in Formula One. The context mentions Sergio Pérez, but it does not provide information about his birth year. However, it does mention other drivers and their achievements. We need to find a Mexican driver who has held the podium and is not Sergio Pérez.

### Final Answer: 
There is not enough information in the context to determine another Mexican Formula One driver who has held the podium besides Sergio Pérez.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:31:10,860 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" and then determine which character they also voiced. Since "A Rather Blustery Day" is a song from the Disney film "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day", I will look for information about the singer of this song. The context mentions that "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" was written by the Sherman Brothers for the same film, and Tigger sang this song. However, I need to find the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day". The context does not directly mention the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day", but it does mention that "Heffalumps and Woozles" was performed by The Mellomen. Since the question asks for a singer who voiced a hedgehog, I will look for information about a hedgehog character in the context. The context mentions Tigger, a hedgehog character, but it does not mention the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day". However, I can infer that the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" might be the same as the singer of "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" since both songs are from the same film. The context does not provide information about the singer of "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers", but it does mention that Tigger sang this song. Therefore, I can infer that the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" might be the same as the singer of "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers", which is Tigger.

The Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with Apple TV. Given that the context mentions the Apple Remote was released in 2005, which is the same year Apple TV was released, it is logical to infer that the Apple Remote was designed for use with Apple TV. Additionally, the context does not mention any other device that the Apple Remote was designed to interact with, making Apple TV the most likely answer.

2025-06-22 16:33:34,750 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments used in their performances. Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the number of instruments used by Badly Drawn Boy or Wolf Alice. However, we can infer that Badly Drawn Boy is a solo project of Damon Gough, who is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist. This suggests that Badly Drawn Boy likely uses a relatively small number of instruments, possibly just a few, as a solo act.

On the other hand, Wolf Alice is a band with multiple members, which typically implies a higher number of instruments used in their performances. However, the context does not provide specific information about the number of instruments used by Wolf Alice.

Given the lack of specific information about the number of instruments used by both acts, we cannot make a definitive conclusion about which act has a higher instrument to person ratio. However, based on the fact that Badly Drawn Boy is a solo act, it is likely that they have a lower instrument to person ratio compared to Wolf Alice, which is a band with multiple members.

### Final Answer:
We cannot determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio based on the provided context.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:36:32,254 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the writer of "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" and the person who died in 2007. The context provides information about the song, its release, and a mention of a person named Shoulders who died in 2007. However, there is no direct connection between Shoulders and the song. The context also mentions a person named Josh Norek, but there is no information about him being associated with the song. The only relevant information is that the song "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" was written by Lee Hazlewood, and the context does not provide any information about him dying in 2007. However, it does mention a person named Shoulders who died in 2007, but there is no connection to the song. The only connection to the song is the mention of Nancy Sinatra, but the question asks for the writer, not the performer.

### Final Answer:

The question asks for the name of the adventure in "Tunnels and Trolls", a game designed by Ken St. Andre. To answer this question, we need to look for information related to "Tunnels and Trolls" in the provided context. The context mentions that "Tunnels & Trolls" is a fantasy RPG designed by Ken St. Andre, but it does not explicitly mention the name of the adventure. However, it does mention that "Crusaders of Khazan" is a computer adaptation of the tabletop game "Tunnels and Trolls". This suggests that "Crusaders of Khazan" might be related to the adventure in "Tunnels and Trolls".

The question asks for the release date of Poison's album "Shut Up, Make Love". The provided context mentions the release date of a song "Be the One" from the album "Crack a Smile...and More!", but it does not directly mention the release date of "Shut Up, Make Love". However, since "Crack a Smile...and More!" is mentioned in the context, it is likely that the album "Shut Up, Make Love" is also from the same time period. The context also mentions the release date of a song from a different album, but it does not provide any information about "Shut Up, Make Love". Since the context does not provide a direct answer, we need to look for a connection between the provided information and the question.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the release date of Poison's album "Shut Up, Make Love".   ✘

The question asks about the origin of the band Buck-Tick, and the provided context does not mention Buck-Tick directly. However, it does mention Atsushi Sakurai, who is associated with Buck-Tick, as an inspiration for Kyo, a vocalist of a different band, Dir en grey. This implies that Buck-Tick is a separate entity from the other information provided. Since the context does not provide any information about Buck-Tick's origin, we need to look for a connection to the provided information. The only connection is through Atsushi Sakurai, but there is no information about Buck-Tick's origin in the context. However, the context does not provide any information about Buck-Tick, but it does provide information about Hayden, a singer-songwriter from Canada. Since the question asks about Buck-Tick, we can infer that the answer is not related to Hayden or Canada.

2025-06-22 16:45:05,714 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Freakonomics and In the Realm of the Hackers are both American documentaries, we need to analyze the information provided. Freakonomics is a podcast and a book that was adapted into a film, but there is no information suggesting it is a documentary. In the Realm of the Hackers, on the other hand, is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but we have information about a documentary called "Kers" and a film called "Hackers" which is not a documentary. However, we can infer that "In the Realm of the Hackers" might be related to the documentary "Kers" since it shares a similar title.

2025-06-22 16:46:17,578 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine which band had more members, we need to identify the number of members in each band. The context provides information about the members of Screaming Trees, but it does not mention the members of Letters to Cleo. However, we can infer that Screaming Trees had at least 3 members: Gary Lee Conner (guitar), Van Conner (bass), and Barrett Martin (drums). Since the context does not provide information about the number of members in Letters to Cleo, we cannot make a direct comparison.

2025-06-22 16:47:43,343 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the key information related to the defeat of Alexander Kerensky and the end of the civil war. The context mentions that the Russian Civil War ended in 1923, but it also mentions that the war continued in Ukraine and Siberia until 1920. However, the question specifically asks when the civil war ended when Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks. Given that the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising was an attempt by Alexander Kerensky to regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his Provisional Government, it is likely that the civil war ended shortly after this event. The Kornilov Affair is mentioned, but it is not directly related to the defeat of Kerensky. Therefore, I will look for a date that is close to the time of the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising.

2025-06-22 16:48:54,467 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the year an Italian physicist, who has worked in France, wrote the book "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics". The context provides information about several Italian physicists, but only one of them is associated with writing a book. The book was written in 2014 and is a bestseller in Italy, translated into 41 languages. The context also mentions the physicist's nationality and the fact that they have worked in France, but it does not specify the year they started working in France. However, it does not provide any information about the physicist who wrote the book. We need to find a connection between the book and the physicists mentioned in the context.

### Final Answer:
There is not enough information in the context to determine the year the Italian physicist started working in France.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:49:50,845 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the war commemorated by the Livesey Hall War Memorial. The context provides information about the memorial, but it does not directly state which war it commemorates. However, it mentions that the memorial commemorates South Suburban Gas Company employees who died in WWI and WWII. Since the memorial commemorates casualties from both wars, it is likely that the war with over 60 million casualties is one of these two wars.

2025-06-22 16:50:58,426 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if both Elko Regional Airport and Gerald R. Ford International Airport are located in Michigan, we need to analyze the information provided in the context. We can start by identifying the location of each airport mentioned. Gerald R. Ford International Airport is explicitly stated to be located in Cascade Township, Michigan. On the other hand, Elko Airport is mentioned to be located near downtown Elko, Nevada, and Pensacola International Airport is located near downtown Pensacola, Florida. Since neither of these locations is in Michigan, we can conclude that only Gerald R. Ford International Airport is located in Michigan.

2025-06-22 16:51:58,190 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The context provided does not directly mention Ralph Hefferline, but it does mention several psychology professors and their affiliations. However, one of the professors mentioned is David C. Funder, who is a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside. Since there is no direct information about Ralph Hefferline, we can infer that the question might be related to the other professors mentioned. However, there is no mention of Ralph Hefferline in the context, which makes it challenging to determine his affiliation. But, we can look for a connection between the provided information and Ralph Hefferline. After re-examining the context, I found that Ralph Hefferline is actually mentioned in the context of a different piece of information not provided in the given snippet. However, I can still try to find a connection. Since the context does not provide any direct information about Ralph Hefferline, I will look for a connection between the provided information and the question. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any direct connection between the provided information and Ralph Hefferline. However, I can try to find a connection between the provided information and the question by looking for a pattern or a common theme. After re-examining the context, I found that all the professors mentioned are affiliated with a university. Therefore, I will assume that Ralph Hefferline is also affiliated with a university. Since David C. Funder is affiliated with the University of California, Riverside, I will look for a connection between Ralph Hefferline and the University of California, Riverside.

2025-06-22 16:53:15,744 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine which dog's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters, we need to analyze the information provided in the context. The context mentions the Scotch Collie, Manchester Terrier, and various Setter breeds. The key information is that the Irish Red and White Setter breed was revived in the 1970s with the help of a male dog from Nagle's Irish Setters, and the breed is part of the Setter family. This implies a connection between Irish Setters and other Setter breeds. Additionally, the context mentions Gordon and Irish Setters as part of the Setter family. Therefore, we can infer that the Setter breeds are related to each other. The Manchester Terrier is not mentioned in relation to the Setter family, and the Scotch Collie is mentioned as a herding dog from Scotland, but there is no direct connection to Gordon and Irish Setters.

### Final Answer: The Manchester Terrier.   ✘

The question asks about the company Sachin Warrier worked for as a software engineer. However, the context provided does not mention Sachin Warrier working as a software engineer. Instead, it mentions Sachin Warrier as a Malayalam playback singer and composer. The context also mentions Sachin Bansal, who is a software engineer and entrepreneur, but it does not mention him working with Sachin Warrier. Since there is no information about Sachin Warrier's work experience as a software engineer, we cannot determine the company he worked for.

### Final Answer: 
There is not enough information to determine the company Sachin Warrier worked for as a software engineer.   ✘

2025-06-22 16:58:49,598 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about Alfred Balk's role in the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media, specifically under which United States Vice President. The provided context mentions various individuals and their roles, but none of them are directly related to the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media. However, the context does mention Gerald Rudolph Ford, who wrote for Governor Rockefeller's committee, but there is no mention of him being involved in the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media. The context also mentions Labor Arthur Goldberg, but it does not specify his role in the committee. Since the context does not provide any information about the Vice President under whom Alfred Balk served, we need to look for a connection between the committee and a Vice President. The only relevant information is that the first Affirmative Action aimed to provide equal workforce opportunities for all U.S. citizens, which was implemented by the government on March 6, 1961. This date is significant because it coincides with the presidency of John F. Kennedy, and his Vice President was Lyndon B. Johnson. However, there is no direct connection between Lyndon B. Johnson and the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media. The context does not provide any information about the Vice President under whom Alfred Balk served.

There is not enough information in the provided context to determine the correct answer.   ✘

To answer this question, I need to identify the coastal area that borders the medieval fortress in Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland on its south side. The context provides information about the location of Dirleton, its proximity to Edinburgh, and the nearby golf courses. However, it does not directly mention the coastal area adjacent to the fortress. I will look for a connection between the given information and the question.

2025-06-22 17:01:10,460 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the writer of a song inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono. The context provided mentions a box set of Phil Spector's 1960s work, but it does not directly mention the song in question. However, it does mention the Beatles' mono mix of "Yellow Submarine" and their final single "Get Back", but neither of these songs is mentioned as being inspired by words on a tombstone. The context does not provide enough information to directly answer the question, but it does mention a box set that could potentially contain the song in question. Since the box set is related to Phil Spector, and the question asks for the writer of the song, it is likely that the song is by Phil Spector.

### Final Answer:
Phil Spector   ✔

The question asks about the type of forum initiated by a former Soviet statesman. To answer this question, we need to identify which Soviet statesman is associated with initiating a forum. The context provides information about various Soviet statesmen, including their roles and periods of service. However, it does not directly mention any of them initiating a forum. We need to look for a connection between the given information and the concept of a forum.

2025-06-22 17:03:51,840 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The context provided describes Silene as a flowering plant with specific characteristics, such as a dioecious reproductive system, the production of flowers in a cyme or leaf axils, and the presence of hairy calyx. This information directly pertains to the classification and characteristics of a plant. Ferocactus, on the other hand, is not mentioned in the context provided. Since the question asks if both Ferocactus and Silene are types of plants, and given that Ferocactus is not mentioned in the context, it can be inferred that the question is likely asking if Silene is a type of plant, which is clearly indicated by the context.

2025-06-22 17:05:26,519 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The context provides information about the Canberra, a British jet-powered bomber, but it was introduced in 1951, after the war. The context also mentions No. 12 Squadron, a RAAF squadron operating in the South West Pacific during WWII, but it does not specify the type of aircraft they used. However, the context does not provide any information about a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre during WWII. Therefore, we need to look for a British jet-powered bomber that was operational during WWII and used in the South West Pacific theatre.

2025-06-22 17:06:38,442 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine the year and conference for the 14th season of the Colorado Buffaloes in the NCAA Division, we need to identify the conference they were in during that season. The context mentions that the 2010 season was their last in the Big 12 Conference, and the 2015 season was their first in the Pac-12 Conference. Since the Buffaloes played 2-6 in conference play in 2010, we can infer that the 14th season must be in the Big 12 Conference.

2025-06-22 17:07:39,753 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, we need to find a connection between Euromarché and the number of hypermarkets operated by the chain that bought it in 1991. We know that Euromarché was bought by Carrefour in 1991. We also know that Carrefour operates 1,462 hypermarkets worldwide as of the end of 2016. Therefore, we can conclude that the chain that bought Euromarché in 1991 operated 1,462 hypermarkets at the end of 2016.

2025-06-22 17:08:45,367 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a race track in the Midwest that hosts a 500-mile race every May. The provided context mentions several NASCAR events, but none of them are located in the Midwest or specifically mention a 500-mile race in May. However, the context does mention the Subway 400, which was a 500-mile event, but it was held at North Carolina Speedway, not in the Midwest. Since the context does not provide any information about a 500-mile race in the Midwest, I will look for any other clues that might be related to the question. The Ogden Tract is mentioned, but it is an old horse racing track and does not seem to be related to the question. The Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 is also mentioned, but it is a 300-mile race, not a 500-mile race. However, the context does not provide any information about a 500-mile race in the Midwest, but it does mention the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which is a well-known racing track in the Midwest.

2025-06-22 17:10:02,098 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini, and the context mentions Gianni Schicchi, a 1-act comic opera by Puccini. The context also mentions that Gianni Schicchi is set in a hypocritical and deceitful medieval Florence. However, there is no direct mention of a film based on Gianni Schicchi. But, the context does mention that the person in question is known as the "Prince of tenors" and made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961. This suggests that the person is a singer, and the question is likely asking about a film featuring this singer in a Puccini opera. The context also mentions Gianni Schicchi, but it does not provide information about a film. However, it does not provide information about the singer's film career either. But, it does mention that the singer made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961, which is a clue. The singer's debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961 is a clue that might be related to the question.

2025-06-22 17:11:22,929 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the writers Ellie Goulding worked with on her third studio album, Delirium. The context mentions that Ellie Goulding released her debut album "Lights" in 2010, and her second album "Halcyon" in 2012. It also mentions that she released her third album "Delirium" in 2015. Since the question specifically asks about her third studio album, I will look for information related to "Delirium". The context mentions that "On My Mind" and "Army" are songs from the album "Delirium", but it does not provide information about the writers of those songs. However, it does mention that Ellie Goulding worked with various producers and artists on her second album "Halcyon", but that is not relevant to the question about her third album. Since the context does not provide explicit information about the writers of "Delirium", I will look for any other relevant information. Unfortunately, the context does not provide any additional information about the writers of "Delirium". However, I can infer that Ellie Goulding likely worked with the same writers she worked with on her previous albums, but that is not explicitly stated.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, the context does not provide enough information to answer the question.   ✘

2025-06-22 17:12:30,647 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the Australian city founded in 1838 that contains a boarding school opened by a Prime Minister of Australia and named after a school in London of the same name. The context provides information about various schools and topics, but only one piece of information directly relates to the question. The key phrase to focus on is "opened by a Prime Minister of Australia and named after a school in London of the same name." This indicates that the school in question was founded by a Prime Minister and has a connection to a school in London. The context mentions a school opened by Prime Minister Robert Menzies, which is a potential match.

The question asks about the series D1NZ being based on a specific oversteering technique. However, the provided context does not mention anything about a series called D1NZ or oversteering techniques. The context appears to be a collection of unrelated information about plot devices, scientific discoveries, and techniques. There is no mention of a series or oversteering. Therefore, it is likely that the question is not answerable based on the provided context.

The question asks for the population of the city where Kirton End is located, based on the 2001 census. However, the provided context does not mention Kirton End directly, but it does mention Kirton, which is a village in Nottinghamshire. Since Kirton End is likely a part of or a hamlet within Kirton, we can infer that the population of Kirton is relevant to the question. However, the context does not provide the population of Kirton from the 2001 census, but it does provide the population of Kirton from the 2011 census, which is 261. Since the question specifically asks for the 2001 census, and there is no information available for Kirton from that year, we cannot determine the population of the city where Kirton End is located.

To determine if both Cypress and Ajuga are genera, we need to analyze the context provided. The context mentions the Cupressaceae family, which includes 27-30 genera with 130-140 species. It also mentions the "Cupressus" genus, which is a polyphyletic group in the Cupressoideae subfamily of the cypress family (Cupressaceae). However, there is no mention of the Ajuga genus in the provided context. Therefore, we can conclude that Ajuga is not mentioned as a genus in the context.

2025-06-22 17:20:33,701 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the name of the executive producer of a film that has a score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The context provides information about Jerry Goldsmith's scores for various films, including "Alien", "L.A. Confidential", and "The Motion Picture Soundtrack". However, it does not directly mention the name of the executive producer for any of these films. The only film mentioned that has a direct connection to an executive producer is "Dinosaurs", but the context does not specify that Jerry Goldsmith composed the score for this film. Therefore, we need to look for a connection between Jerry Goldsmith's scores and the films mentioned in the context.

The question asks for the Roud Folk Song Index of the nursery rhyme inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?". To answer this question, we need to identify the nursery rhyme that inspired "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" and then find its Roud Folk Song Index number. However, the given context does not directly mention the nursery rhyme "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" or its Roud Folk Song Index number. But, it does mention other nursery rhymes and their Roud Folk Song Index numbers. Since we cannot find the Roud Folk Song Index number of the specific rhyme we are looking for, we cannot provide a definitive answer.

The context does not provide information about the number of countries where ExxonMobil has operations. However, it does mention that ExxonMobil's Nigerian subsidiary, MPN, operates in Nigeria, and ExxonMobil was formed by the merger of Exxon and Mobil, which were both multinational corporations. This suggests that ExxonMobil is a multinational corporation with operations in multiple countries. However, the exact number of countries is not specified in the provided context.

2025-06-22 17:28:02,883 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the organization recognized by a larger Hall of Fame that Vince Phillips held a junior welterweight title. To answer this question, we need to identify the Hall of Fame that is mentioned in the context and determine if it is a larger Hall of Fame. The context mentions the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame, which inducted Julian "Fighting Farrier" Holland in 2008. However, it does not mention Vince Phillips being inducted into this Hall of Fame. Therefore, we need to look for another Hall of Fame that Vince Phillips is associated with. The context does not provide direct information about Vince Phillips being inducted into a Hall of Fame, but it does mention that he held multiple titles, including Central American and Latin American junior welterweight titles. This suggests that Vince Phillips may be associated with a Hall of Fame that recognizes boxers from these regions.

2025-06-22 17:29:24,370 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the name of a singer who had a song released as the lead single from the album "Confessions" that was stuck behind another song for eight consecutive weeks. The context mentions a song "I Don't Wanna Know" that spent 8 weeks at number 2, which matches the criteria. The album "Confessions" is also mentioned, which is the album that the song "Yeah!" was released from. Since "Yeah!" was the lead single from the album "Confessions" and it was a huge hit, it's likely that it was the song that was stuck behind another song for eight consecutive weeks.

### Final Answer: Usher   ✔

2025-06-22 17:30:51,143 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the younger brother of the guest stars of "The Hard Easy" episode. However, the provided context does not mention "The Hard Easy" episode or its guest stars. The context mentions various episodes from different TV shows, including "The Office", "Brother from Another Series", "Time", and "Traitor's Gate". Since "The Hard Easy" is not mentioned, it's not possible to determine the guest stars or their relationships. Therefore, I will conclude that the question cannot be answered based on the provided context.

### Final Answer: 
There is not enough information to answer the question.   ✘

2025-06-22 17:31:58,511 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the league cup that Wigan Athletic F.C. competed in during the 2017-18 season, specifically mentioning that it's known by a name due to sponsorship reasons. However, the provided context does not mention the name of the league cup or any information about the 2017-18 season. It does provide information about Wigan Athletic F.C.'s history, the stadium, and other teams, but none of this information is relevant to the question. Since the context does not provide any information about the league cup, I will look for any information that might be related to the league cup.

Upon reviewing the context, I found that the Trinidad and Tobago League Cup is mentioned, but it's not related to Wigan Athletic F.C. or the 2017-18 season. However, I also found that the context mentions the Football League, which is a league that Wigan Athletic F.C. has competed in. Given that the question asks about a league cup, I will assume that the league cup in question is related to the Football League.

### Final Answer:
Carabao Cup   ✔
2025-06-22 17:31:58,511 │ INFO     │ Top-k answer: The 2017–18 Wigan Athletic F.C. season will be a year in which the team competes in the league cup known as the First Citizens Cup for sponsorship reasons.   ✘

The question asks about the inhabitant of the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014. However, the provided context does not mention the 122nd SS-Standarte being formed in 2014. It actually mentions that the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in Strasbourg in 1940. Since the question specifically asks about the formation in 2014, and there is no information about the 122nd SS-Standarte being formed in 2014, I will look for information about the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 1940.

The question asks for the name of a 1996 loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Romeo & Juliet" written by James Gunn. To answer this question, I need to find a connection between James Gunn and a 1996 adaptation of Romeo & Juliet. The context provides information about James Gunn's career, including his screenwriting credits for "Tromeo and Juliet" and "Scooby-Doo". Since "Tromeo and Juliet" is a 1996 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet, and it is mentioned that James Gunn wrote the screenplay for this film, I can conclude that this is the adaptation being referred to in the question.

2025-06-22 17:44:03,250 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, we need to identify the nationality of Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach, who are mentioned in the context as social anthropologists. The context provides information about their training and work, but does not explicitly state their nationality. However, it does mention that Alfred Gell was trained by Edmund Leach and Raymond Firth, who are both British anthropologists. This implies that Alfred Gell is likely to be British as well. Similarly, Edmund Leach is also mentioned as Alfred Gell's trainer, suggesting that he is also British.

2025-06-22 17:45:13,470 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer the question, we need to identify the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours. The context mentions that the 1925 Birthday Honours were awarded by King George V, as it was published in "The London Gazette" on June 3, 1925. We are then asked to find the birth year of this King. Since we know the King's name is George V, we can look for information about his birth year.

2025-06-22 17:46:27,069 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To find the county seat of the county where East Lempster, New Hampshire is located, we need to identify the county where East Lempster is situated. Since East Lempster is an unincorporated community in Lempster, New Hampshire, we can infer that Lempster is a town in New Hampshire. The context does not provide information about the county seat of Lempster, but it does mention Grafton County as a county in New Hampshire. Given that Woodsville is the traditional county seat of Grafton County, we can conclude that East Lempster is located in Grafton County.

### Final Answer: Woodsville   ✔

The question asks for the stage name of a Rock singer, Robert C Seger, who was born on May 6, 1945. The context provides information about Bob Seger, an American singer-songwriter, born on the same date. The details about Gary Cherone and "The Chinaman" are irrelevant to the question. Therefore, the stage name of the Rock singer is likely to be Bob Seger.

2025-06-22 17:49:00,134 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the practice of filling armed forces vacancies that was deemed constitutional in the Rostker v. Goldberg case. The context provides information about the case, including the Supreme Court's ruling that the male-only draft was constitutional. This suggests that the practice in question is related to the draft. Additionally, the context mentions that the US draft was used to fill military vacancies, which further supports this connection. Therefore, the practice that was deemed constitutional is likely related to the draft.

2025-06-22 17:50:05,641 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the American multinational confectionery, food, and beverage company that sells Handi-Snacks. To answer this question, we need to identify the company associated with Handi-Snacks from the given context. The context provides information about various companies and their products, but it does not directly mention Handi-Snacks. However, we can infer that the company we are looking for is likely to be one of the large multinational companies mentioned, such as Mondelez, PepsiCo, or Kraft Foods. Since Mondelez is specifically mentioned as a global snack and food company formed from Kraft Foods' global brands after a 2012 spin-off, it is a strong candidate. Additionally, the context does not provide any information that would rule out Mondelez as the correct answer.

### Final Answer: Mondelez   ✔

2025-06-22 17:51:22,665 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the name of a woman from the book "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine" who was also a former White House intern. The context provides information about the book and its content, including the story of Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern who was involved in a scandal with President Bill Clinton. Given that the book specifically mentions women who were targeted by the Clinton machine, and Monica Lewinsky is mentioned as a woman who interacted with Bill Clinton, it is reasonable to infer that she is the woman being referred to in the question.

### Final Answer: Monica Lewinsky   ✔

2025-06-22 17:52:43,401 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the birthdate of an American lawyer, lobbyist, and political consultant who was a senior member of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The context provides information about Paul Manafort, who is described as a senior member of the Trump campaign, and Brad Parscale, who was the digital media director for the Trump campaign. However, the question specifically asks for the birthdate of the person who was a senior member of the Trump campaign, which is Paul Manafort. The context also mentions that Paul Manafort co-founded lobbying firm Black, Manafort & Stone in 1980, but this information is not relevant to the question about his birthdate.

### Final Answer: 
1980 is not the birthdate, it is the year Paul Manafort co-founded the lobbying firm.   ✘

To answer the question, we need to find a connection between the novel "Nina" by Lourenço Mutarelli and the provided context. Since the context does not directly mention "Nina" or its publication year, we need to look for any mention of Lourenço Mutarelli or a novel that might be related to "Nina". The only mention of Lourenço Mutarelli is in the context of the 2014 film "Quando Eu Era Vivo", which is based on his novel. However, there is no direct connection to "Nina" in this context. We need to look for any other possible connection.

Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the provided context to determine the year the novel that Lourenço Mutarelli based "Nina" on was first published.   ✘

2025-06-22 17:58:44,587 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about Andrew Jaspan's affiliation with a not-for-profit media outlet. The context mentions The Conversation, which is described as an independent, not-for-profit media outlet. However, there is no mention of Andrew Jaspan in the context provided. The context also mentions other unrelated information about state media, The Conversation, and the Vatileaks scandal. Since Andrew Jaspan is not mentioned in the context, we need to look for any other information that might be related to him. Upon reviewing the context again, I found that Andrew Jaspan is actually mentioned in relation to The Conversation, but not as a co-founder. However, I found that Andrew Jaspan is indeed associated with The Conversation, but as a co-founder of The Conversation UK.

2025-06-22 18:00:02,048 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the American film director who hosted the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002. To answer this question, we need to find a connection between the given context and the year 2002. The context mentions Neil LaBute, but it does not directly mention him hosting the awards. However, it does mention the film "Possession" (2002), which is directed by Neil LaBute. This suggests that Neil LaBute was active in 2002. The context also mentions the 28th Independent Spirit Awards, which took place in 2013, and the 18th Independent Spirit Awards would have taken place 11 years earlier, in 2002. Since the context does not provide a direct answer, we can infer that Neil LaBute might have hosted the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002.

2025-06-22 18:01:58,056 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I will analyze the context provided to determine if both Gibson and Zurracapote contain gin. The context mentions that the Gibson is a gin-based cocktail, which directly indicates that it contains gin. However, there is no mention of Zurracapote in the context, so I will look for any information that might relate to it. The only mention of Zurracapote is in the context of a maritime flag, which is unrelated to drinks. Since there is no information about Zurracapote being a drink, let alone a gin-based one, I will conclude that the question is likely referring to a drink that is not mentioned in the context.

2025-06-22 18:03:07,527 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the annual documentary film festival presented by a British journal of literary essays. The context mentions several documentary film festivals, but none of them are directly associated with a British journal of literary essays. However, the London Review of Books is mentioned, which is a British journal of literary essays. The London International Documentary Festival (LIDF) is also mentioned, and it is held in London, which is a British city. Therefore, it is likely that the festival mentioned in the question is the London International Documentary Festival.

The question asks for a filmmaker known for animation, and we need to identify the correct person between Lev Yilmaz and Pamela B. Green. We can eliminate Lev Kuleshov because he is mentioned in the context as a Russian filmmaker and film theorist, but there is no mention of him being associated with animation. We can also eliminate Pamela B. Davis because she is a pediatric pulmonologist, not a filmmaker. We are left with Lev Yilmaz and Pamela B. Green. However, there is no information in the context about Lev Yilmaz being associated with animation. On the other hand, Pamela B. Green is mentioned as a filmmaker who has directed and produced independent animation films and music videos.

2025-06-22 18:09:17,496 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Yingkou and Fuding are the same level of city, we need to analyze the context provided. Yingkou is mentioned as a city in Liaoning Province, with a railway station and an airport, indicating it is a city. Fuding is also mentioned as a city, but it is in Fujian Province, and it is mentioned alongside other county-level cities and counties, suggesting it is also a city. However, the key information is that Fuding is mentioned as a county-level city in Fuzhou City, which implies that Fuding is a smaller administrative unit within Fuzhou City, whereas Yingkou is a standalone city.
