2025-06-22 12:58:55,636 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell. To answer this question, we need to identify the woman who played Corliss Archer and then find information about her government position. The context mentions a radio show "Date with Judy" and a film "A Kiss for Corliss" starring Shirley Temple, but it does not mention Corliss Archer. However, it does mention a film "Kiss and Tell" which is likely the one related to Corliss Archer. Unfortunately, the context does not provide direct information about the government position held by the actress who played Corliss Archer. However, it does mention a film "A Kiss for Corliss" which is a different film. Since the context does not provide a direct answer, we need to look for a connection between the actress who played Corliss Archer and a government position. The context mentions a Secretary of State, but it does not provide a connection to the actress who played Corliss Archer. However, it does mention that the Secretary of State gained additional functions from the First Secretary of State, a role held by the Deputy Prime Minister. This information is not relevant to the question. The context also mentions a radio show "Date with Judy" and a TV series "The Village Accountant", but these are not related to the question. Since the context does not provide a direct answer, we need to look for external information or make an educated guess.

2025-06-22 13:00:31,943 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a science fantasy young adult series told in first person, with companion books narrating the stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. The context provides information about the Animorphs series, but it does not mention enslaved worlds and alien species. It also mentions companion books by Square Enix, but they are related to video games, not science fantasy series. The context also mentions the author's other books, but they do not match the description. However, the mention of "shadowshapers" in the context hints at a science fantasy setting, and the author's other books, such as "The Seer And The Sword", "The Healer's Keep", and "The Light Of The Oracle", suggest a fantasy setting. But, none of these books match the description of a science fantasy series with companion books about enslaved worlds and alien species. However, the mention of "Indigo Magic" as a sequel, which might imply a larger universe with multiple worlds and species, and the fact that the author has written companion books, makes me think of a series that might fit the description.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, the context does not provide enough information to pinpoint a specific science fantasy young adult series that matches the description.   ✘

To determine if the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion are located in the same neighborhood, we need to establish their locations. The Esma Sultan Mansion is mentioned to be in Istanbul, Turkey, but its specific location is not provided. On the other hand, there is no information given about the Laleli Mosque's location. However, since both are in Istanbul, Turkey, we can infer that they could potentially be in the same city. But to confirm if they are in the same neighborhood, we need more specific information about their locations.

The question asks for the city in New York where the director of the romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" is based. However, the provided context does not mention anything about the director of "Big Stone Gap" or its location. The context provides information about various cities and locations, including Clinton in Minnesota, Hoboken in New Jersey, and East London and Bangkok, but none of these are related to the director of "Big Stone Gap". Since the context does not provide any information about the director or the movie, it is not possible to determine the correct answer.

2025-06-22 13:06:40,987 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the seating capacity of the arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games. The context mentions the Androscoggin Bank Colisée as the home arena of the Lewiston Maineiacs. However, there is no information provided about the seating capacity of the Androscoggin Bank Colisée in the given context. But, we can infer that the information about the seating capacity is not relevant to the question as the context does not provide any details about the seating capacity of the Androscoggin Bank Colisée. However, we can look at the information about the Robert and Concetta Dwyer Arena which is not the home of the Lewiston Maineiacs but rather of the men's ice hockey team at Niagara University. This information is not relevant to the question. The Victoriaville Tigres relocated to Boisbriand and joined the QMJHL in 2011, which is also not relevant to the question. The 2006-2007 Quebec Major Junior Hockey League season and the 2011-12 QMJHL season are also not relevant to the question. Therefore, the answer cannot be found in the given context.

### Final Answer:
There is not enough information to answer the question.   ✘

2025-06-22 13:07:43,839 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine who is older between Annie Morton and Terry Richardson, we need to look for information about their birthdates. We can find this information in the context provided. Annie Morton's birthdate is mentioned as October 8, 1970. However, there is no direct mention of Terry Richardson's birthdate in the context. But, we can infer that since Terry Richardson was convicted in 1968 for a crime that occurred in 1967, he must have been born before 1967.

Terry Richardson   ✔

2025-06-22 13:09:18,741 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Local H and For Against are both from the United States, we need to look for any information in the context that directly relates to their origins. Local H's album being about US politics and released in 2012 to coincide with the presidential election suggests a connection to the US. However, there is no direct information about For Against's background or origins in the provided context. We can only infer that Local H is from the US based on the context of their album.

To answer this question, I need to find a connection between Guns N' Roses and a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former New York Police detective. The context mentions that Guns N' Roses released their debut album "Appetite for Destruction" in 1987, but this information is not directly related to the question. However, it does not provide any information about a movie starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a former NYPD detective.

I also noticed that the context mentions that the movie "Last Action Hero" is a 1993 film, and Guns N' Roses has been active since the 1980s.

The question asks whether two specific buildings, Random House Tower and 888 7th Avenue, are used for real estate. To answer this question, we need to determine if these buildings are related to real estate activities. The context provided mentions the Real Estate Market, balloon mortgages, and loan products, which are all related to real estate. However, it does not provide any information about Random House Tower. On the other hand, 888 7th Avenue is described as an office skyscraper, which is a type of building often used for real estate purposes.

2025-06-22 13:15:48,344 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the football manager who recruited David Beckham and determine the timeframe during which they managed Manchester United. The context mentions several managers who managed Manchester United, but only one is associated with recruiting David Beckham. The Class of '92 documentary mentions the rise of young Manchester United footballers, including David Beckham, from 1992, which suggests that the manager in question was likely active during this time. I will look for a manager who was in charge during the 1990s.

2025-06-22 13:18:17,976 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the conference name that the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team was formerly known as from 1988 to 1996. To answer this question, we need to look for information in the context that mentions the team's conference history. The context mentions the team's current conference, the America East Conference, but does not provide information about the conference name from 1988 to 1996. However, it does not provide any information about the team's conference history before joining the America East Conference. Since the context does not provide a direct answer, we need to use our general knowledge about the team's history to find the answer.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, I cannot verify the conference name from 1988 to 1996 for the Vermont Catamounts men's soccer team.   ✘

2025-06-22 13:19:39,203 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Giuseppe Verdi and Ambroise Thomas are both opera composers, we need to analyze the context provided. The context mentions Giuseppe Verdi as an Italian opera composer and tutor, and lists a film about his life, indicating that he is indeed an opera composer. Additionally, the list of major opera composers includes various notable composers, suggesting that the list is focused on opera composers. However, there is no mention of Ambroise Thomas in the context provided. To determine if Ambroise Thomas is an opera composer, we need to look for information about him in the context. Unfortunately, the context does not provide any information about Ambroise Thomas. However, we can infer that since Giuseppe Verdi is an opera composer, and the list of major opera composers is provided, it is likely that Ambroise Thomas is also an opera composer, as he is included in the list.

To answer this question, I need to identify the president's administration that Roger O. Egeberg served as Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs. The context provides information about various individuals and their roles, but it does not directly mention Roger O. Egeberg's affiliation with a specific president.

2025-06-22 13:21:59,700 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the writer from England, and we have two options: Henry Roth and Robert Erskine Childers. We need to analyze the context to determine which one is from England. Erskine Childers is mentioned as a British writer and Fenian revolutionary, which suggests he is from England. There is no information provided about Henry Roth's nationality or background, but since the question specifically asks for the writer from England, we can infer that Erskine Childers is the correct answer.

### Final Answer: Robert Erskine Childers   ✔

The question asks for another Mexican Formula One driver who has held the podium, besides Sergio Pérez, who is also a Force India driver born in 1990. The context mentions a few drivers and their achievements, but it does not provide information about other Mexican drivers. However, it does mention Sergio Pérez, who is a Mexican driver born in 1990 and drives for Force India. To find another Mexican driver who has held the podium, we need to look for information about other Mexican drivers mentioned in the context.

2025-06-22 13:24:42,300 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" and then determine which character they also voiced. The context provides information about the song "A Rather Blustery Day" being from the Disney film "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day", but it does not directly mention the singer. However, it does mention that "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" was written for the same film and features Tigger. Since "A Rather Blustery Day" is also from the same film, it is likely that the same singer voiced both songs. The context also mentions that Tigger sang "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers", but it does not explicitly state that the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" is Tigger. However, considering the context, it is reasonable to infer that the singer of "A Rather Blustery Day" is also Tigger.

2025-06-22 13:25:55,882 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a device aside from the Apple Remote that can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with. Given that the Apple Remote was released in 2005 for use with various products, including Macintosh computers and Apple TV, we can infer that it was designed to interact with Apple devices. Considering the context, a device that can control Apple devices would be a suitable answer. The mention of the Siri Remote, which is designed for Apple TV with Siri capabilities, suggests that it can control Apple TV, which is one of the devices the Apple Remote was designed for. Therefore, the Siri Remote is a likely candidate.

### Final Answer: Siri Remote   ✘

2025-06-22 13:27:24,823 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine which performance act has a higher instrument to person ratio, we need to consider the number of instruments used in their performances. Since the context does not provide explicit information about the number of instruments used by Badly Drawn Boy and Wolf Alice, we can infer that the ratio is related to the number of musicians in each band. Badly Drawn Boy is a solo project of Damon Gough, which means he is the only person performing. On the other hand, Wolf Alice is a band with multiple members, but the context does not provide the exact number. However, based on general knowledge, a typical band has more than one person, so it is likely that Wolf Alice has a higher instrument to person ratio than Badly Drawn Boy.

To answer the question, we need to identify the person who wrote "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'" and also died in 2007. The context mentions Nancy Sinatra's debut album "Boots" featuring the hit single "These Boots Are Made for Walkin'", but it does not mention her death in 2007. However, it mentions a person named Shoulders who died in 2007, but there is no connection to the song. We need to look for another connection.

2025-06-22 13:31:43,084 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine the year Virginia Commonwealth University was founded, we need to look for information in the context that mentions the founding year of the university. Since the context is about the VCU Rams men's basketball team, we can infer that the information about the university's founding year might be indirectly related to the team's history. However, there is no direct mention of the founding year in the provided context. We can look for any mention of the university's name or its founding year in the context, but it seems that the context only provides information about the basketball team's performance and coaching history.

### Final Answer: 
There is not enough information in the context to determine the founding year of Virginia Commonwealth University.   ✘

To answer this question, I will analyze the given context to determine if both Dictyosperma and Huernia are described as a genus. The context provides information about the genus Huernia, including its description, origin, and naming. However, it does not mention Dictyosperma. Since the question asks about both genera, I will look for any mention of Dictyosperma in the context to determine if it is also described as a genus.

The question asks for the name of the adventure in the game "Tunnels and Trolls", a fantasy RPG designed by Ken St. Andre. The context provided includes information about the game, its publication, and its computer adaptation, but does not directly mention the name of the adventure. However, it does not provide any information about the adventure itself. To answer the question, we need to look for any mention of an adventure or campaign in the context. Since the context does not provide any direct information about the adventure, we need to look for any indirect clues or related information that might help us answer the question.

2025-06-22 13:35:33,233 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the release date of Poison's album "Shut Up, Make Love". The context provides information about Poison's single releases, other artists' albums and songs, and unreleased tracks. However, none of this information directly mentions the release date of "Shut Up, Make Love". We need to look for a mention of the album itself in the context. The only relevant information is the mention of the album "Crack a Smile...and More!" which is associated with Poison and released in 2000. Since "Shut Up, Make Love" is mentioned as a single from this album, we can infer that the album was released in 2000.

The question asks about the origin of the band Buck-Tick, and the provided context does not mention Buck-Tick directly. However, it does mention Atsushi Sakurai, who is associated with Buck-Tick, as an inspiration for Kyo, a vocalist of a different band, Dir en grey. This implies that Buck-Tick is a Japanese band, as Atsushi Sakurai is a Japanese musician. There is no information in the context about Hayden, the singer-songwriter from Canada, being related to Buck-Tick.

2025-06-22 13:37:39,254 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about a French ace pilot and adventurer who flew L'Oiseau Blanc. The context provides information about various pilots and their attempts at flying the Atlantic Ocean, including Charles Nungesser and François Coli, who attempted a non-stop transatlantic flight from Paris to New York in 1927. The Levasseur PL.8, a modified biplane, was built for this attempt. Given that L'Oiseau Blanc is mentioned in the context, and it is known that Charles Nungesser and François Coli flew a modified biplane called L'Oiseau Blanc in their attempt, it can be inferred that Charles Nungesser is the French ace pilot and adventurer who flew L'Oiseau Blanc.

2025-06-22 13:38:56,686 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Freakonomics and In the Realm of the Hackers are both American documentaries, we need to analyze the context provided. Freakonomics is a podcast and a book, which was adapted into a film, but there is no information suggesting it is a documentary. In the Realm of the Hackers, on the other hand, is a documentary, but the provided context does not specify its origin. However, since "Kers" is mentioned as a documentary about the Australian hacker community, it is likely that "In the Realm of the Hackers" is also a documentary about the same topic, but with a different title. Since "Hackers" is mentioned as a film with cult classic status, it is possible that "In the Realm of the Hackers" is a documentary about the same topic, but the provided context does not confirm its American origin.

To determine which band had more members, we need to identify the number of members in each band. The context provides information about the members of Screaming Trees, but it does not mention the members of Letters to Cleo. However, we can infer that Screaming Trees had at least 3 members: Gary Lee Conner (guitar), Van Conner (bass), and Barrett Martin (drums). Since the context does not provide any information about Letters to Cleo's membership, we cannot make a direct comparison.

2025-06-22 13:42:54,572 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the year when an Italian physicist, who has worked in France, wrote the book "Seven Brief Lessons on Physics". The context provides information about several Italian physicists, but only one of them is mentioned to have written the book. The book was published in 2014, and the context does not provide a direct answer to the question. However, it mentions that the book is a bestseller in Italy, translated into 41 languages, which implies that the author is likely a well-known Italian physicist. The context also mentions that Carlo Rovelli is the author of the book, and it is known that he has worked in France.

2025-06-22 13:43:56,308 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the war commemorated by the Livesey Hall War Memorial, which had over 60 million casualties. To answer this question, we need to identify the war that had over 60 million casualties and is related to the Livesey Hall War Memorial. The context provides information about the memorial, but it does not directly mention the number of casualties. However, it does mention that the memorial commemorates employees who died in WWI and WWII. We know that both WWI and WWII had significant casualties, but only one of them had over 60 million casualties. WWI had approximately 37 million casualties, while WWII had approximately 50-80 million casualties. Since the memorial commemorates both wars, it is likely that the war with over 60 million casualties is WWII.

### Final Answer: WWII   ✔

2025-06-22 13:45:06,067 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if both Elko Regional Airport and Gerald R. Ford International Airport are located in Michigan, we need to analyze the information provided in the context. We can start by identifying the location of each airport mentioned. Gerald R. Ford International Airport is explicitly stated to be located in Cascade Township, Michigan. On the other hand, Elko Airport is mentioned to be located near downtown Elko, Nevada. Since Elko, Nevada is not in Michigan, we can conclude that Elko Regional Airport is not located in Michigan. Therefore, only Gerald R. Ford International Airport is located in Michigan.

The context provided does not directly mention Ralph Hefferline, but it does mention several psychology professors and their affiliations. However, one of the professors, David C. Funder, is mentioned as a psychology professor at the University of California, Riverside. Since there is no direct information about Ralph Hefferline, we can infer that the question might be related to the other professors mentioned. However, there is no mention of Ralph Hefferline in the context, which makes it challenging to determine his affiliation. But, we can look for any indirect clues or connections. Upon reviewing the context again, I noticed that there is no direct connection between Ralph Hefferline and any of the mentioned universities or cities.

2025-06-22 13:47:17,285 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine which dog's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters, we need to analyze the information provided in the context. The context mentions the Irish Red and White Setter, which is related to the Irish Setter, and also mentions the English Setter, which is related to the Gordon Setter. The Scotch Collie is mentioned as a separate breed originating from Scotland and Northern England, with no direct connection to the Setter family. Therefore, the breed that is most likely to have ancestors that include Gordon and Irish Setters is the one that is part of the Setter family.

The context provided does not mention Sachin Warrier working as a software engineer. However, it does mention Sachin Bansal, who is a software engineer and entrepreneur. Since the question asks about Sachin Warrier, I will look for any information related to him. The context mentions Sachin Warrier as a Malayalam playback singer and composer, but it does not provide information about his work as a software engineer or the company he worked for. However, it does mention that he is from Chandigarh and graduated from IIT Delhi, which suggests that he may have worked in the tech industry. Unfortunately, there is no specific information about the company he worked for.

The question asks about Alfred Balk's role in the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media, specifically under which United States Vice President. The provided context mentions various individuals and their roles, but none of them are directly related to the Committee on the Employment of Minority Groups in the News Media. However, the context does mention Labor Arthur Goldberg, who led the Committee's operations. Since the question is about the Vice President under whom Alfred Balk served, we need to find a connection between Alfred Balk and a Vice President.

### Final Answer:
Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention Alfred Balk's affiliation with a Vice President, making it impossible to determine the correct answer based on the given information.   ✘

2025-06-22 13:53:46,068 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the coastal area that borders the medieval fortress in Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland on its south side. The context mentions that the parish of Dirleton is bordered by the Firth of Forth, which is a coastal area. Since the fortress is located in Dirleton, it is likely that the Firth of Forth borders the fortress on its south side.

2025-06-22 13:54:56,899 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the writer of a song inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set "Back to Mono". To answer this question, we need to identify the song and its writer. The context mentions a box set called "Back to Mono" which is a 4-CD or 5-LP box set of Phil Spector's 1960s work. This suggests that the song is likely written by Phil Spector. Additionally, the context mentions that the song was inspired by words on a tombstone, which is a common theme in Phil Spector's work.

2025-06-22 13:56:11,377 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the type of forum initiated by a former Soviet statesman. To answer this question, we need to analyze the context provided, which lists several Soviet statesmen and their roles. However, there is no direct mention of a forum initiated by any of them. We need to look for a connection between the given information and the concept of a forum. A forum is a place or medium where people can discuss or exchange information on a particular topic. Given the context, we can infer that the forum might be related to a platform for discussion or exchange of ideas. Upon reviewing the information, we notice that Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union, is mentioned. Gorbachev is known for introducing reforms and promoting openness, which could be related to the concept of a forum.

2025-06-22 13:57:32,520 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The context provided describes Silene as a flowering plant, mentioning its reproductive system, geographical distribution, and physical characteristics. It also lists specific species of Silene, such as Silene stenophylla, Silene antirrhina, and Silene menziesii, all of which are identified as flowering plants. There is no mention of Ferocactus in the context, which suggests that Ferocactus is not part of the information being discussed. Therefore, based on the information given, it can be inferred that Ferocactus is not a type of plant being described in this context.

2025-06-22 13:58:59,436 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The context provides information about the Canberra, a British jet-powered bomber, but notes it was introduced in 1951, after the war. The context also mentions No. 12 Squadron, a RAAF squadron operating in the South West Pacific during WWII, but does not specify the type of aircraft they used. However, the context does not provide information about a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. Given the information, it seems there is no direct answer to the question based on the provided context.

To determine the year and conference for the 14th season of the Colorado Buffaloes in the NCAA Division with a record of 2-6 in conference play, we need to analyze the given information. The context mentions the Buffaloes' performance in different seasons, including their conference records. We are looking for a season where they had a 2-6 record in conference play. The information about the 2011 season is the most relevant, as it explicitly states that the Buffaloes finished 5-7, 2-6 in the Big 12 in 2011.

2025-06-22 14:01:24,440 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, we need to find a connection between Euromarché and Carrefour. We know that Euromarché was bought by Carrefour in 1991. We also know that Carrefour operates a large number of hypermarkets worldwide. The question asks how many hypermarkets Carrefour operated at the end of 2016. Since Euromarché was bought by Carrefour in 1991, it is likely that the number of hypermarkets operated by Carrefour at the end of 2016 includes the hypermarkets that were previously operated by Euromarché.

The question asks for a race track in the Midwest that hosts a 500-mile race every May. The context provides information about various racing events, but none of them are specifically mentioned as being held in the Midwest. However, one event, the 500 Mile Race, is mentioned, but it does not specify a location. To find the answer, I need to look for a connection between the 500 Mile Race and a specific track in the Midwest.

### Final Answer:
There is not enough information in the provided context to determine the specific race track in the Midwest that hosts a 500-mile race every May.   ✘

2025-06-22 14:03:41,990 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini, and the context mentions Gianni Schicchi, a 1-act comic opera by Puccini. The context also mentions that Gianni Schicchi is set in a hypocritical and deceitful medieval Florence. However, there is no direct mention of a film based on Gianni Schicchi. But, the context does mention that the person in question, who is referred to as the "Prince of tenors", made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961. This suggests that the person is a singer, and the mention of Puccini's opera and the Santa Fe Opera implies that the person may have performed in a film adaptation of a Puccini opera. The only Puccini opera mentioned is Gianni Schicchi, and it is a film that comes to mind that features a famous tenor, Mario del Monaco, who was known as the "Prince of Tenors". The film is "Gianni Schicchi" (1963), an Italian film directed by Franco Zeffirelli.

To answer this question, I will look for information about Ellie Goulding's third studio album, Delirium, and identify the writers she worked with on that album. Since the context mentions that Ellie Goulding released her debut album "Lights" in 2010 and her second album "Halcyon" in 2012, I can infer that Delirium is her third studio album. I will then look for any information about the writers she collaborated with on Delirium.

Unfortunately, the context does not provide information about the writers Ellie Goulding worked with on her third studio album, Delirium.   ✘

2025-06-22 14:06:06,690 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, I need to identify the Australian city founded in 1838 that contains a boarding school opened by a Prime Minister of Australia and named after a school in London of the same name. The context provides information about various schools, but only one school is mentioned as being opened by a Prime Minister of Australia. The school was opened in 1961, which is after 1838, so it is a possible candidate. The school's name is mentioned as being named after a school in London, which is another clue. I will look for a school that matches these criteria.

2025-06-22 14:07:37,744 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The context provided does not directly mention D1NZ, but it does mention a technique called "reset button" which is a plot device used in various forms of media. However, the question asks about D1NZ being based on an oversteering technique. Oversteering is a driving technique, and D1NZ is a series that involves racing. Therefore, it is likely that D1NZ is a series based on an oversteering technique in the context of racing.

The context provided does not directly mention Keith Bostic or Jerry Glanville's age. However, it does mention Jerry Glanville as the coach of the 1993 Houston Oilers season, which implies that he is an older individual, likely in his 40s or 50s at that time. There is no information about Keith Bostic's age or any notable achievements that would suggest he is a football coach or player from the same era as Jerry Glanville.

The question asks for the population of the city where Kirton End is located, based on the 2001 census. However, the provided context does not mention Kirton End directly, but it does mention Kirton, which is a different location. Since Kirton is mentioned, I will look for information related to Kirton. However, the context does not provide the population of Kirton from the 2001 census, but it does provide the population of Kirton from the 2011 census, which is 261. Since the question specifically asks for the 2001 census, I will look for any information that might be related to Kirton End and the 2001 census. Unfortunately, there is no direct information about Kirton End in the provided context. However, I can look for any information that might be related to the location of Kirton End. The context mentions that Kirton is located in Nottinghamshire, England, which is 3 miles east of Ollerton. However, there is no information about Kirton End's location. Since I couldn't find any direct information about Kirton End, I will look for any information that might be related to the population of the city where Kirton is located. The context mentions that Kirton is located in Nottinghamshire, England, but it does not provide the population of the city where Kirton is located from the 2001 census.

### Final Answer:

To determine if both Cypress and Ajuga are genera, we need to analyze the given context. The context mentions the Cupressaceae family, which includes 27-30 genera with 130-140 species. It also mentions the "Cupressus" genus, which is a polyphyletic group in the Cupressoideae subfamily of the cypress family (Cupressaceae). However, there is no mention of the Ajuga genus in the provided context. Therefore, we can conclude that Ajuga is not mentioned as a genus in the context.

2025-06-22 14:13:08,144 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a distinction held by a former NBA player who was a member of the Charlotte Hornets during their 1992-93 season and was also the head coach for the WNBA team Charlotte Sting. To answer this question, I need to identify a person who meets both criteria. The context provides information about the Charlotte Hornets' history, including their re-establishment in 1991, their suspension of operations, and their return as the Bobcats in 2004. It also mentions the WNBA changes, including the folding of the Miami Sol and Portland Fire, the loss of the Charlotte Sting's NBA affiliation, and the Detroit Shock winning the championship. However, it does not provide direct information about a specific player who was a member of the 1992-93 Charlotte Hornets and later became the head coach of the Charlotte Sting. Therefore, I will look for a connection between the two teams and the given time period.

The question asks for the name of the executive producer of a film that has a score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. The context provides information about Jerry Goldsmith's scores for various films, but it does not directly mention the name of the executive producer for any of those films. However, it does not provide any information about the executive producer of the film with a score composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Therefore, we need to look for a connection between the information provided and the question.

There is not enough information in the context to determine the name of the executive producer of the film with a score composed by Jerry Goldsmith.   ✘

2025-06-22 14:16:10,356 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine who was born earlier, Emma Bull or Virginia Woolf, we need to find information about their birth dates. Since the context does not provide direct information about Emma Bull's birthdate, we can look for any mention of her birthdate or age in the given text. However, the text does not provide any information about Emma Bull. On the other hand, the text does mention Virginia Woolf, but it does not provide her birthdate either. However, we can infer that the text is discussing Virginia Woolf's work and legacy, which suggests that she is a well-known figure. Given that the text does not provide information about Emma Bull's birthdate, we can look for external knowledge about her birthdate. Emma Bull is an American fantasy and science fiction author, and according to external knowledge, she was born in 1953. Virginia Woolf, on the other hand, was born in 1882.

The question asks for the Roud Folk Song Index of the nursery rhyme inspiring "What Are Little Girls Made Of?". To answer this question, we need to identify the nursery rhyme that inspired "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" and then find its Roud Folk Song Index number. However, the given context does not directly mention the nursery rhyme "What Are Little Girls Made Of?" or its Roud Folk Song Index number. But, it does mention other nursery rhymes and their Roud Folk Song Index numbers. Since there is no direct information about "What Are Little Girls Made Of?", we cannot find its Roud Folk Song Index number.

2025-06-22 14:18:57,563 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The context provided does not directly mention the number of countries where ExxonMobil has operations. However, it does mention that ExxonMobil's Nigerian subsidiary, MPN, operates in Nigeria, and ExxonMobil was formed by the merger of Exxon and Mobil, which were both large multinational corporations. This suggests that ExxonMobil likely operates in many countries, but the exact number is not specified. Since the question asks for the number of countries where another corporation (not ExxonMobil) has operations, we need to look for information about that corporation. However, the provided context does not mention the number of countries where that corporation operates. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact number of countries where that corporation has operations based on the given information.

There is not enough information to answer the question.   ✘

2025-06-22 14:21:49,188 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the organization recognized by a larger Hall of Fame that Vince Phillips held a junior welterweight title. To answer this question, we need to identify the Hall of Fame that is mentioned in the context and determine which one is larger. The context mentions the Australian National Boxing Hall of Fame, but it also mentions that Julian "Fighting Farrier" Holland was inducted into this Hall of Fame. However, there is no mention of Vince Phillips being inducted into this Hall of Fame. Therefore, we need to look for another Hall of Fame that is mentioned in the context. The context does not provide any information about Vince Phillips being inducted into any Hall of Fame, but it does mention that he held multiple titles, including Central American and Latin American junior welterweight titles. This suggests that the larger Hall of Fame that recognized Vince Phillips' junior welterweight title is likely the International Boxing Hall of Fame, which recognizes boxers who have achieved success in multiple regions, including Central America and Latin America.

2025-06-22 14:23:06,815 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the name of a singer whose song was released as the lead single from the album "Confessions" and had a popular song stuck behind it for eight consecutive weeks. To answer this question, I need to identify the album "Confessions" and its lead single that spent eight weeks at number 2. The context mentions several songs and their chart performances, but only one album is mentioned as "Confessions". I will look for information related to this album to find the lead single that matches the given criteria.

### Final Answer:
Usher   ✔

The question asks for the younger brother of the episode guest stars of "The Hard Easy". However, the provided context does not mention "The Hard Easy" or any information about its guest stars. The context mentions various episodes from different TV shows, including "The Office", "Brother from Another Series", "Time", and "Traitor's Gate". Since there is no mention of "The Hard Easy", it is not possible to determine the younger brother of its guest stars.

The question asks about the league cup that Wigan Athletic F.C. participated in during the 2017-18 season, specifically mentioning that it is known by a name due to sponsorship reasons. However, the provided context does not mention the 2017-18 season or any information about a specific league cup that Wigan Athletic F.C. participated in during that time. The context does mention the Trinidad and Tobago League Cup, but it is not related to Wigan Athletic F.C. or the 2017-18 season. Since the context does not provide any information about the league cup that Wigan Athletic F.C. participated in during the 2017-18 season, I will look for any information about the league cup that Wigan Athletic F.C. participated in, regardless of the year.

### Final Answer:
Carabao Cup   ✔

2025-06-22 14:26:32,737 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for Tara Strong's major voice role in an animated series based on the DC Comics fictional superhero team, the "Teen Titans". The context provides information about Tara Strong's voice work in various animations and video games, but specifically mentions her involvement in "Teen Titans" and "The Powerpuff Girls". Since "Teen Titans" is mentioned as a show based on the DC Comics series, and Tara Strong is mentioned as a voice actor in "Teen Titans", it is likely that her major voice role in an animated series based on the "Teen Titans" is in the show "Teen Titans".

The question asks for the inhabitant of the city where the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in 2014. However, the context provided does not mention the 122nd SS-Standarte being formed in 2014. Instead, it mentions that the 122nd SS-Standarte was formed in Strasbourg in 1940. Therefore, the correct city to consider is Strasbourg. The context does not provide information about the current inhabitants of Strasbourg, but it is known that Strasbourg is a city in France.

2025-06-22 14:29:43,859 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the name of a 1996 loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's "Romeo & Juliet" written by James Gunn. To answer this question, I need to find a connection between James Gunn and a 1996 adaptation of Romeo & Juliet. The context mentions that James Gunn started his career in the mid-1990s with screenwriting credits for "Tromeo and Juliet" and "Scooby-Doo". This suggests that James Gunn was involved in the writing of "Tromeo and Juliet", which is a 1996 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.

2025-06-22 14:36:46,410 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To answer this question, we need to identify the nationality of Alfred Gell and Edmund Leach, who are mentioned in the context as social anthropologists. The context provides information about their training and work, but it does not explicitly state their nationality. However, it does mention that Alfred Gell was trained by Edmund Leach and Raymond Firth, and since Edmund Leach is mentioned as a British social anthropologist, it can be inferred that Alfred Gell is also British.

To answer this question, we need to identify the King who made the 1925 Birthday Honours. The context mentions that the 1925 Birthday Honours were awarded by King George V, as it was published in "The London Gazette" on June 3, 1925. We are then asked to find the birth year of this King. Since we know the King's name is George V, we can look for information about his birth year.

To find the county seat of the county where East Lempster, New Hampshire is located, we need to identify the county where East Lempster is situated. Since East Lempster is an unincorporated community in Lempster, New Hampshire, we can infer that Lempster is a town in New Hampshire. We need to look for information about the county where Lempster is located. The provided context mentions various counties, but none of them are explicitly linked to Lempster. However, we can look for a county in New Hampshire that is not mentioned in the context, as Lempster is likely located in one of the unmentioned counties.

### Final Answer:

The question asks about the practice of filling armed forces vacancies that was deemed constitutional in the Rostker v. Goldberg case. The context provides information about the case, including the Supreme Court's ruling that the male-only draft was constitutional. This suggests that the practice in question is related to the draft. Additionally, the context mentions that the US draft was used to fill military vacancies, which further supports this connection. Therefore, the practice that was deemed constitutional is likely related to the draft.

The question asks for the name of a woman from the book "Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine" who was also a former White House intern. The context provides information about several women who interacted with Bill Clinton, including Monica Lewinsky, Paula Jones, and others. However, the key detail to focus on is the mention of a woman who was a former White House intern. Among the provided information, only one woman is mentioned as a former White House intern: Connie Mariano.

2025-06-22 14:45:43,151 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for the birthdate of an American lawyer, lobbyist, and political consultant who was a senior member of the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. The context provides information about several individuals associated with Donald Trump's campaign, including Paul Manafort, Brad Parscale, and others. However, the question specifically asks for the birthdate of a lawyer, lobbyist, and political consultant who was a senior member of Trump's campaign. Paul Manafort is mentioned as a senior member of Trump's campaign and has a background in law, lobbying, and politics. Brad Parscale is mentioned as a digital media strategist, not a lawyer or lobbyist. The other individuals mentioned are not described as lawyers, lobbyists, or political consultants.

### Final Answer: 
Paul Manafort was born in 1949.   ✔

The question asks how many copies of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote sold. However, the provided context does not mention any information about the sales of Roald Dahl's variation on a popular anecdote. It does mention several collections of his short stories, but none of them are specifically about a variation on a popular anecdote. The context does mention a short story called "Mrs. Bixby and the Colonel's Coat", but it does not provide any information about the sales of this story or any variation on a popular anecdote. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the number of copies sold based on the provided context.

2025-06-22 14:51:29,737 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about Andrew Jaspan's affiliation with a not-for-profit media outlet. The context mentions The Conversation, which is described as an independent, not-for-profit media outlet. However, there is no mention of Andrew Jaspan in the context provided. We need to find a connection between Andrew Jaspan and a not-for-profit media outlet. Upon reviewing the context, I found that Andrew Jaspan is actually mentioned in relation to The Conversation, but not as a co-founder. However, I also found that Andrew Jaspan is indeed associated with The Conversation, but as a co-founder of The Conversation UK.

The question asks for the American film director who hosted the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002. To answer this question, we need to find a connection between the given context and the year 2002. The context mentions Neil LaBute, but it does not directly mention him hosting the awards. However, it does mention the film "Possession" (2002), which is directed by Neil LaBute. This suggests that Neil LaBute was active in 2002. The context also mentions the 28th Independent Spirit Awards, which took place in 2013, but it does not provide information about the 18th Independent Spirit Awards. Since the question specifically asks about the 18th Independent Spirit Awards in 2002, we need to look for a connection between Neil LaBute and the awards in that year.

To answer this question, we need to identify the ingredients or characteristics of the drinks Gibson and Zurracapote. The context provides information about various drinks, including cocktails, soft drinks, and liquors. We need to find a connection between these drinks and gin. The Gibson is explicitly mentioned as a gin-based cocktail, which indicates it contains gin. However, there is no direct information about Zurracapote. We need to look for any indirect clues or associations that might link Zurracapote to gin.

2025-06-22 14:56:16,157 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks about the month in which the annual documentary film festival presented by a British journal of literary essays is held. The context mentions several documentary film festivals, but only one is associated with a British journal. The London International Documentary Festival (LIDF) is mentioned, but it is not presented by a British journal of literary essays. The New Haven Documentary Film Festival (NHdocs) is presented by a British journal, but it is held in June, not in the UK. However, the context does not provide information about the specific British journal associated with NHdocs. The closest match is the London Review of Books, which is a British journal of literary essays. The London International Documentary Festival is not associated with this journal, but it is held in March-April. Since the question asks about a British journal, and the London Review of Books is a British journal, we can infer that the festival associated with this journal is the one held in March-April.

2025-06-22 14:59:32,532 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
The question asks for a filmmaker known for animation, and the context provides information about several filmmakers. Lev Kuleshov is mentioned as a filmmaker, but the context does not specifically mention animation as one of his areas of expertise. Ary is mentioned as a director of a 2D animation movie, but the question asks for a filmmaker known for animation, not a director of a specific movie. Pamela B. Green is mentioned as a writer, producer, and filmmaker who has directed and produced independent animation films and music videos, which matches the criteria of being known for animation.

The question asks for the city where the ambassador of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region to China is based. However, the provided context does not mention the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region or its ambassador to China. The context includes information about the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong, the capital of Morocco (Rabat), and other unrelated topics. Since there is no mention of the Rabat-Salé-Kénitra administrative region or its ambassador to China, it is not possible to determine the correct answer based on the given context.

2025-06-22 15:01:38,173 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : ### Rationale:
To determine if Yingkou and Fuding are the same level of city, we need to analyze the context provided. Yingkou is mentioned as a city in Liaoning, China, and also as a location in Fujian, China, in the context of the Roman Catholic Diocese. Fuding is mentioned as a city in Fujian, China, and also as a city bordering Wafangdian, which is a city in Liaoning, China. This suggests that Yingkou and Fuding are cities in different provinces, but the mention of Yingkou in Fujian and Fuding in Liaoning indicates that they are both cities, but in different provinces.
