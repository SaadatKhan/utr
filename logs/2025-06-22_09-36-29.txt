2025-06-22 09:38:51,382 │ INFO     │ Ground-truth answers: ['yes']
2025-06-22 09:38:51,382 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : Rationale:
To determine if Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood are of the same nationality, we need to analyze the information provided in the context. We know that Ed Wood is a cult filmmaker who was the subject of a biographical film directed by Tim Burton, indicating that Ed Wood is likely an American filmmaker. Scott Derrickson is mentioned as the director of several films, including "Sinister" and "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", which suggests that he is also a filmmaker. However, there is no direct information about Scott Derrickson's nationality in the context. But, since Ed Wood is an American filmmaker, and Scott Derrickson is also a filmmaker, it is likely that Scott Derrickson is also American, as the context does not provide any information about him being from a different country.

2025-06-22 09:40:16,745 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : Rationale:
The question asks about the government position held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell. However, the context provided does not mention the film Kiss and Tell, but rather A Kiss for Corliss, which is a different film. The context does mention a radio show called "Meet Corliss Archer" and a woman who voiced several characters in animated shows. The connection between the radio show and the film is not explicitly stated, but it is possible that the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film also played the role in the radio show. The context also mentions a man who edited several TV series, but this is not relevant to the question. The mention of the Secretary of State is also not relevant to the question.

The context does not provide a clear answer to the question, but it does mention a radio show called "Meet Corliss Archer" which is likely related to the film A Kiss for Corliss. The woman who voiced Judy Jetson, Penelope Pitstop, and Josie in "Josie and the Pussycats" is not mentioned in the context as being associated with the radio show "Meet Corliss Archer". However, the context does not provide any information about the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell.

However, the context does mention that the woman who voiced Judy Jetson, Penelope Pitstop, and Josie in "Josie and the Pussycats" was also a radio and voice actress. The context also mentions a radio show called "Date with Judy" which aired from 1943-1956, but it does not mention the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell.

However, the context does mention a radio show called "Meet Corliss Archer" which aired in 1954, and it is likely that the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell also played the role in the radio show. Unfortunately, the context does not provide the name of the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell.

The question asks for a science fantasy young adult series told in first person, with companion books narrating the stories of enslaved worlds and alien species. The context provides information about the Animorphs series, but it does not mention enslaved worlds and alien species. It also mentions companion books by the author, but they are related to a different series. The context also mentions a series by the author with a character named Sierra, but it does not match the description of the question. However, the mention of "shadowshapers" and "Indigo Magic" suggests a connection to a series that might fit the description.

2025-06-22 09:42:57,143 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : Rationale:
To determine if the Laleli Mosque and Esma Sultan Mansion are located in the same neighborhood, we need to establish a connection between the two locations. The context provides information about Esma Sultan, who is mentioned as a daughter of Sultan Abdülaziz and Gevheri Kadın, and also as a mother of Bezmiâlem Sultan and Rahime Perestu Sultan. However, there is no direct information linking Esma Sultan to the Laleli Mosque. On the other hand, the context does not provide any information about the Laleli Mosque. We need to find a connection between the two locations.

However, the context does not provide any information about the location of the Esma Sultan Mansion or the Laleli Mosque. But, we can infer that the Esma Sultan Mansion is located in Istanbul, Turkey, as mentioned in the context. The Laleli Mosque is also located in Istanbul, Turkey. Therefore, it is possible that the two locations are in the same neighborhood.

2025-06-22 09:44:33,417 │ INFO     │ Ground-truth answers: ['Greenwich Village, New York City']
2025-06-22 09:44:33,417 │ INFO     │ AEM answer  : Rationale:
The context provided does not mention the director of the romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" or any information related to the film. However, it does mention a few unrelated topics such as cities in Minnesota and New York, a film "I Love NY", a TV show, and a layout based on the Lackawanna Railroad. Since the question specifically asks about the director of the romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" being based in a New York city, I will look for any mention of New York city in the context.

The only mention of New York city is in the context of the film "I Love NY", which is an Indian romantic comedy, and in the mention of Governor DeWitt Clinton, who is from New York. However, there is no mention of a director of a romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" being based in New York city.

Since the context does not provide any information about the director of the romantic comedy "Big Stone Gap" or its location, I will conclude that the answer cannot be determined from the provided context.

Final Answer:
There is not enough information to determine the answer.   ✘
